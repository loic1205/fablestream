this is the complete story of Destiny. 

The Light and Dark Saga. 




<!-- Le Jardin et les deux entitées -->




The beginning is of course where we should begin, 
but what truly happened at the beginning of our story is the subject of much debate. 
Legends and myths of old tell us of how there was a place before time and the universe, known as "The Garden". 
Within this Garden there stood a Tree of Silver Wings and vast Meadows of potential and metaphor. 
Within the Grove there were two figures :
    First there was a gardener, 
who during the long days would seed life in rapturous celebration. 
Throughout the Garden this life would grow and bloom into many wild forms... 
Until at the fall of dusk, 

    The Winnower came,
with a scything blade cut away the chaff from the wheat. 

The Gardener and The Winnower are rumoured to have existed in this cycle for untold eons, 




<!-- La chute du Jardin et le début d'un conflit universel -->




until The Gardener grew dissatisfied with it, believing it to have grown repetitive and unremarkable. 
Across this game of existence that The Gardener and The Winnower played, 
a single repetitive pattern always emerged. It was always the winning play. 
A final shape that defined the form of victory. 

The Gardener insisted that there should be a new rule that allowed for new complexity to also find success. 
The Winnower disagreed, stating that from this idea unnecessary suffering would be born. 
From this disagreement, conflict brewed between The Gardener and The Winnower. 
Their conflict brought about the creation of the universe, and The Garden fell into ruin. 
The Gardener and The Winnower fought and brought down the Tree of Silver Wings and left its stump to smoke amid the meadows. 




<!-- la création de l'univers et l'apparition de nouvelles forces dans l'univers -->




If rumours are to be believed, this conflict also brought about the escape of primal patterns that survived
and took root in the universe with an aim of survival at all costs. 
These were known as The Vex and though you might know them by their brass frames, 
they are actually the tiniest of molecular life built into a connected consensus. 
Radiolarian structures creating grand designs. 

This story of The Gardener and Winnower and their conflict was told to us through some of our first interactions with The Black Fleet. 
The great Pyramid Vessels of our most ancient enemy. It gives us some of our only potential ideas about what occurred at the start of the universe. 
hether this story is true or not is still debated to this day, 
but what is not debated is that the primal forces that The Gardener and Winnower supposedly aligned with are very real. 
The Gardener seemingly was aligned with the Light, a power associated with the physical universe, creation, and chaos. Matter, Gravity, Energy. 
The Winnower seemed to be aligned with the Darkness, which is associated with control and the domain of the mind, One's will, dreams, and nightmares. 
These powers of The Light and The Dark are known to supersede the typical laws of the universe, 
bending and breaking those laws of physics and matter on the whims of those that use these powers of light and dark,
they sidestep causality and for these reasons individuals who wield the light and dark are referred to as paracausal or acausal 




<!-- La première civilisation paracausale -->




these powers are found in the universe in a pair of ancient presences incomprehensible things entities of A Sort 
they are the traveler which is a source of the light 
and the veil which is a source of the darkness 
when these two great constructs were created is unclear 
but our story truly begins with their Discovery by an ancient and unnamed people long ago 
for the purposes of our story I shall simply call them the precursors 
to all that would follow the precursors were once Nomads who would wander across their home world to survive 
that was until the day they discovered something buried in the wastes of their world 
they discovered the traveler, it blessed this precursor civilization with the Bounty that it would provide to thousands of others 
the nomadic precursors Advanced their technology and Society under the silent benevolence of the traveler 
but whilst it doted on them with many gifts its silence meant that the precursors were left with little in the way of guidance 
they had been given abundance but no meaning or Direction their search for meaning defined their entire Society 
all of them were seeking to understand how to bring about a perfect Universe 
many factions would search for this simple idea and how it might be accomplished they called it the final shape 
after much time the scholars of the precursor people discovered that the traveler shared a connection to another great structure 
out in the deepest reaches of space this was the veil 
and they rushed to claim it after they were made aware of its existence 
realizing that whilst The Traveler presented the powers of the light 
the veil presented the powers of something very different, Darkness, 
to the precursor people this discovery was meant to change everything for the better 
they knew much about the light of the traveler they knew of the bounty it could bring 
but they also knew that the light bred chaos and destruction when untamed and unchecked 
through the veil they learned the power of darkness and saw that through its ability to control 
the merging of the two might create a degree of autonomy over the universe that had never before been conceived of 
they aspired in that moment to Control the Chaos of the Traveler's light by strengthening its connection to the veil and merging the two 




<!-- La poursuite du conflit entre lumière et Ténèbres -->




If Only They had succeeded they might at last have forged the final shape that they had conceived of so long ago 
but when they attempted to forge this connection The Traveler rejected the link and abandoned the precursor people 
what happened next must have been the most calamitous time within the precursor Society 
Terror and uncertainty must have spread through their minds there must have been bitterness there must have been hatred
but no matter what they felt, what happened next would bring the ruin that they had experienced to Untold trillions across the Stars 
the precursor people having been abandoned by the light turned to the powers of Darkness for salvation 
understand that the light is not inherently good and the Darkness is not inherently evil 
but the precursors were fueled by hatred and their desperation spoke for itself 
recovered records indicate that a group amongst them known as the penitent struck down all others who dissented against their ways 
they believed that they were meant to fix the universe and create the final shape regardless of whether the universe consented or not 
they used the powers within Darkness to merge their consciousnesses together into a compound being of immense power 
their assimilation spelled an end to the precursor civilization and gave rise to a wretched thing born of a bottomless hatred of the traveler 
this entity would be known by a thousand names over a thousand worlds all of them burned to nothingness over the course of its existence 
we would one day come to know it as the witness and so it set out into the Stars to pursue the traveler 
the witness took the vessels of the civilization that had brought about its creation 
an armada of obsidian Black Pyramid vessels which represented destruction Untold 
along with this black Fleet the witness brought the veil pursuing The Traveler with the same intent as its precursor 
the witness would see the combination of light and darkness
and with it a world without change a world without chaos would be brought about 
an immutable perfected final shape to the universe and this time unlike the precursors 
the witness would not seek the final shape out of a need for Perfection alone 
it would seek it out of a desire to subjugate The Traveler and all those that might oppose its will 




<!-- La croisade du Témoin et le 1er Disciple  -->

    [ la tragédie des Luans ]




but if it was to succeed the witness would need to gather adherence to its cause 
disciples that would help pave the way for its purpose that is what led to the rise of the first disciple 
and they would not call him a conqueror or a mere Tyrant he was worse he would be known as the subjugator 
after the traveler had left the precursor people to their fate 
it enacted a pattern that it would follow for eons to come 
it would move onward and find another civilization to uplift 
this cycle has been repeated countless times and as best we know it in the Traveler's wake 
the witness has always followed meaning that wherever the traveler has found itself eventually Calamity and ruin would follow 
over the course of its Journey The Traveler would arrive at a world orbiting a binary star called Lu 
it had blessed the Luan people with the Bounty of the light and 
they would also grow and rise in much the same way as the precursor civilization had 
the Luan civilization would be split in two by this action 
there were those who lived Beneath The Traveler forming a harsh regime that would rule the planet 
this regime would send out its killers that hunted traditional tribal peoples and suppressed them 
those that lived free of this regime had to contend with the two harsh sons of lubre and with the terrifying forer that called the planet home 
by the time the traveler had left, the luans the division in their society had become a wound that would never heal 
a scar upon their people that governed their entire way of life be they of the regime or of the tribes savagery 
rules this world a savagery that would be its undoing for it was into this world and these Savage peoples 
that rol was born though he was originally born into the tribal nomadic Society rol's parents had come from the regime's city 
as rol grew up he saw how the regime's sanctioned Killers known as stalkers 
hunted those from the tribal peoples and seemingly spared none in their quest for blood 
there was only one who was bloodier than the stalkers though and that was his father Relic 
born of the regime's savagery Relic would return the stalker's malice to them and 
defended his Newfound people by bathing in the stalker own bloody viscera as he tore them in two 
but relic's family did not approve of such savagery and eventually they would be his moderating influence and 
he would be drawn away from such acts of gratuitous Violence by the family that he had chosen 
but for his son rol these actions were not the mark of a villain they were simply what was necessary to survive 
with his father's example driving him R developed a sadistic streak and and followed his Father's Footsteps into violence 
by the time he had killed his first stalker rol would see his father being Carried Away by a raiding band of the regime's killers and 
in his father's name he swore Vengeance he hunted the stalkers through the darkened wastes of his home World seeking Vengeance for his father Relic 
he took a glaive from one of the stalkers and called it Relic sword it was his objective 
he would defend his father just like his father would have defended him but by the time Rook discovered what had truly happened 
his realization would change the name of his glaive for his father's betrayal was written upon the robes he wore 
he now wore the colors of the regime and the stalkers R was carried away by the stalkers to the regime's city 
he would have died there but his father spoke on his behalf and 
told the regime authorities that R would role in the stalkers for he was a mighty killer and 
Rook would do so because at least amongst the ranks of these killers there was a degree of honesty 
despite his years of battling against them the regime may have been harsh but nobody lied about who they were 
unlike his father and thus the glaive that he had stolen from a stalker 
had its name changed from relics Ward to relics Bane 
most importantly for rol he was able to freely enjoy the blood lust that his father had sated long ago 




    [ l'avénnement du 1er Disciple ] 




one day his father left the city to search for the family that he had left behind 
Relic intended to smuggle them into the city proper so that they might finally live in peace 
but in order to reach the city they would need to cross an abyss over a narrow bridge 
a scar across all of Lu much like their society had been clefted into too on the other side of this narrow bridge 
through the single choke point that they needed to pass rol was standing and he intended to end his father 
but curiously enough rol was momentarily swayed from violence his mother and father apologized 
they apologized for R's Exile when he had followed his father's violence
for the poor example his father had set long ago for the inaction he had taken 
for not telling him more for not telling him how the regime's actions could be seen as cruel and 
why he had chosen to save his family now for but a moment it seemed as though ral's family might find Peace at Last 
perhaps if things had proceeded differently R might have also found peace and Reconciliation alongside his family and 
they might have lived out the days that they had left in the city in some measure of Harmony 
but for one reason or another rol fell into the abyss 
did he fall of his own accord 
was he pushed 
did he trip 
was something else there to pull him down 
the circumstances are not clear but what is clear is this 
when Rook looked up at the faces of the family that he was slowly falling away from 
he did not see sorrow or heartbreak or pain as he fell in their faces 
he realized something else was written they were relieved 
this was the Betrayal that would define rol 
it showed him the truth of the universe 
it showed him that there was no place for weakness or the petty lies that held Society together 
like his deep in the abyss he would at last discover truth 
how long r fell for isn't known but when he did finally land 
in this dismal swamp at the base of the Abyss he was not alone 
there were Myriad creatures moving to consume his very body broken as it was 
but it was here as well that rol beheld something else for the first time he laid eyes upon the witness 
it saw rol for what he was a thing of hatred ready to bring ruin to those Liars above 
the witness mended his body and his broken Eng glave 
it empowered rol with terrible darkness and with an ability known only as the witness's luster 
something we still do not understand fully to this day 
when rol asked what he was meant to do the only word the witness uttered was ruin 
with his Newfound power in hand and with a purpose granted to him in Vengeance 
rol climbed the endless Ravine of the Abyss clawing his way up out of Darkness 
until he beheld the surface once more a confused Sun had fallen into the pit 
but what had crawled out was no sun at all it was a monster, a new being of hate,
rol returned to the city of lubre and enacted his final Judgment of his people 
he first slew his parents then the rest of his family 
the city watched on in horror and saw rol for what he was 
but in his hands rol held a power greater than eventhe slaughter that he had enacted 
he held the witness's luster and in the other hand his glaive 
rol siphoned the energy from Lu's own saic sun and channeled it into the witness's gifts and 
with his own glaive he struck at the surface of his Planet 
the weapon had been ren,amed twice
because of his father
and once more in accordance with its new purpose 
a purpose displayed with but this singular strike it would be known as lue's ruin and beneath rol's Blade 
with the power of the witness the planet cracked R destroyed his entire planet and shattered the Suns 
of lub seeing the chaos that he had wrought for a moment R was overwhelmed seeing the devastation 
he fell into the ever expanding Abyss that had consumed his world and he lost Consciousness once more
when he awoke there was no lub no regime no City only he remained the last known Survivor of his entire species 
he beheld the witness once more and saw the totality of all that had happened across his life 
he beged and pleaded and wept and regretted the lesson the witness would show him 
the lesson it was attempting to teach was that these feelings were of no consequence 
that all the life on lubre was of no consequence 
that they were of no consequence because they did not serve its goals 
the witness's Eternal purpose the formation of finality the end of the universe 
in this context no one that rol had killed had mattered only rol mattered rol had long believed 
that his civilization was but lies and so the lies of his civilization melted away 
as he stood and foresaw his new place in the universe R was asked by the witness what he felt
to this as he took his glaive in one hand and the witness's luster in the other rol said relief 
it was here that he became the first disciple of the witness 
the first of its messengers of Doom that would Faithfully destroy its foes 
though not all would serve for the same reasons 
all would serve not as kings not as Gods 
but as disciples prophets saviors serving existence 
whilst the many disciples of the witness would conduct many terrible campaigns of war and error 
rol would be the first and by most accounts the most powerful 
from his actions would spawn a legacy of Bloodshed that would make the Stars themselves tremble 
a legacy that would begin with Lu's destruction and whose Heights would be found Upon A Distant gaseous World 
an ancient place with a roiling ocean beneath a depth of cloud a world known as fundament 
with his Newfound purpose rol would Slaughter countless civilizations in the name of the witness 
in the name of of its great final purpose 




<!-- La tentative du Voyageur  -->




the greatest conquest of the first disciple and His Dark Master would take place on a distant gas giant called fundament 
A World with 52 moons and whose gravity was so great that smaller planetoids had been pulled in by its gravity 
colliding with its surface, collapsing into its oceans and becoming great continents on its surface 
it was on this world that the witness and its first disciple 
would feverishly go about the busy work of sewing Devastation once more 
The Traveler had settled above fundament amongst its moons 
He was uplifting a civilization there known as the ammonite 
the witness foresaw that soon it would move to uplift another species on the world Below on fundament itself 
they were the Krill all the while there were even greater forms of life here 
Leviathan creatures that dwell within the oceans 
these leviathans were the first of the witness's targets 
it came to them and offered them Powers nestled within darkness 
in those Powers lay a truth and purpose so terrible that it would haunt The Very shape of existence 
with its Promises of death the witness offered them the logic of the sword 
the truth that nothing has ever lived that will not one day die and 
the attached premise that those who are strong enough to exist will go on existing by the right of the sword alone 
but this was not mere philosophy it was a practice that led to real power 
curses and Magics wreathed in the darkness itself would be derived from The Sword logic 
in time the leviathans would be twisted into new forms if they followed this dark power 
but even before those that consumed of these Magics turned into the great ravenous worms that we would 
know of now their people had been clefted in two and war was soon to break out the war between the 
leviathans and the traitors that would one day become the worms was brutal and vicious fundaments 
oceans roiled with blood as father and mother fought brother and sister fought son and daughter 
it was a roaling Carnage that engulfed an entire people and left few survivors one was a great 
creature known as Assa she managed to escape her people's Fate by sinking into an ascendant dream 
seemingly this means that she used the ascendant plane to escape a parallel reality to our own 
that mirrors it in a darker more changeable form to those that have strong will she would Tha 
through ascendant dreams until she returned to the physical universe and landed in the oceans of a 
distant system called Saul she would carry with her the knowledge of who the witness had been 
what it had become and what it intended for the universe her eyes were wide and her gaze was long 
she would spy the war across the stars and would understand the shape of fate and how it needed to 
progress if we were to stop the oncoming Calamity but the battle back on fundament continued to rage 
when the worms were at an end there were but a handful that remained a mother known known as Zeta 
and her five Offspring Yul Zol Ur Aya and ARA they had embraced the way of the sword logic as was 
described by the witness and they were imprisoned in the Deep there a leviathan watched over them 
as it had them held in fundaments crushing core it isn't clear if this creature who imprisoned them 
was of the same species as arel and what the wor had once been it might well have been and if 
so it might well have been the last of the survivors of that Great War the last who rejected 
the witness's offer we simply do not know but what we do know is that its power was great enough that 
it could dominate the remaining worms it spanned the supposed size of continents and was known 
to all others simply as the Leviathan with the worms numbers diminished rol and the witness would 
enact the next stage of their plan subjugation rol would dive into the deep and enlist the worms in 
servitude to the witness's plan he effortlessly conquered the Leviathan which addressed him and 
demanded that he stop rol responded by removing one of its ribs in a display of dominance 
descending into the deep he spoke to Zeta the mother of the worms and off offered her a dark 
pact the witness had need of her power and of her children's power it would offer her children's 
sustenance and survival in exchange for loyalty having few other options and seeing the scope of 
rol's power it was clear that this was no bargain it was a demand and so Zeta accepted thus as he 
took their mother to the surface as both a source of power and a captive the new newly anointed 
children of Zeta the so-called worm Gods named him the subjugator rol took portions of the worms that 
would form into their L the small worms that we now know from killing so many Hive and with them 
he enacted the greatest of the witness's plans he left one Lara in fundaments oceans ensuring 
that it would wash up and be found by a leader of one of the Krill Nations the next people that 
the traveler was meant to uplift the leader who discovered the worm L was the king of the osmium 
Dynasty and this Dead Worm L would quickly become his familiar for it would whisper the witnesses 
terrible lies to him lies of an oncoming horrific Calamity the old osmium king would grow obsessed 
with this Doom which would supposedly come in the form of a great godwave that would wipe away 
all things he neglected all other things in pursuit of this truth even neglecting his three 
children whose now dead names orash sathona and SRO would be spoken only an Apocrypha but whose 
true ascendant names would one day go on to bring Terror to the universe only the eldest sibling 
orash had his attention and only when the two of them were studying the Stars for proof of the 
approaching Doom the witness's plans for these siblings was thus the most cunning of them would 
acquire her father's L upon her father's death it would whisper to her of the same cataclysm 
written in the stars and would tell her that to find Salvation for her people she would need 
to descend into the deep these were the Whispers told by the lying worm to saona a simple lie but 
one that would reshape the history of her people forever all came to pass as the witness planned 
and in time the siblings Dove down into the deep there saa's older sibling orash stood within the 
deepest part of fundament core and made a pact with the worm Gods ca's five children if the Krill 
would consume their L the worms would provide them with power and immortality immortality that they 
had long sought an escape to their short lives and the power to claim their revenge in exchange 
the siblings and any who consumed the Lara of the worms would provide an eternal blood tithe and 
forever venerate the worm their God the creel would forever have to commit acts of violence 
and Devastation by following their nature if they failed to do do so their worms would consume them 
and they would perish the bargain was accepted and thus orash sathona and Sho ceased to be thus alrix 
savathun and Zorra were born together these three siblings would stand with the power of zeta's 
five worm God children they would be claimed by the witness's powers before the traveler 
had a chance to uplift them thus The Traveler plans were subverted alri savathun and Zorra 
would go on to unite the Krill peoples now believing in the sword logic of the worms and in 
the promise of their own power after cleansing the surface of fundament they would go on to scour its 
moons destroying the ammonite and butchering the Leviathan all in the name of their Newfound Gods 
a change Came Upon them as a people and they would no longer be known as the krill as their new 
purpose of being the great winnowing blade was made clear they would become known forever more as 
the hive these would be some of the most fanatical Servants of the sword logic they would spread out 
Across the Universe and beneath their blades the witness would see yet more worlds burn in Pursuit 
Of The Traveler though they would not necessarily know the witness to be their true Master The 
Hive would serve their purposes nonetheless tools puppets created by rol but the hive are a tale 
unto themselves in their long and storied history kings and queens and princes would rise and fall 
power would be gained lost and forsaken but always at the heart of all their machinations there would 
be a link to each of the three new hiive Gods alrix the Navigator and king of shapes savathun 
the queen of lies and deception and zeor Wrath The Hive God of War they would leave fundament 
behind and look for new Killing Fields and killing Logics the tale of the hive is one filled 
with lies built upon a lie told Long Ago by the witness to saona now now savathun the 
witch Queen predominantly though we have but a single perspective to judge the millions of 
years worth of Hive history by the perspective of Alx Who Would One Day become orx the taken 
King he recorded his version of events of the hive's history and we have seen it in a series 
of calcified fragments we would one day know the knowledge contained in these fragments 
by a different name the books of Sorrow these books may not be completely trustworthy 
especially because they say nothing of rol the witness or the great lie that turned saa's mind to 
the deep and wrought the young Krill siblings to the worm gods of fundament but they are our best 
and only record of the hive's history a history that is Theirs to tell as they were so often the 
victors hundreds of civilizations were snuffed out by the advancing armadas the Swarms of the hive 
through their Slaughter and through the sword logic Alx savathun and Zorra would create Throne 
worlds cysts in reality pocket Dimensions that defied the laws of the universe nestled within 
the ascendant plain upon their deaths the newly ascended hi Gods would be reborn in these Throne 
worlds and only Within These Throne worlds could they ever truly be killed thus even in the face of 
fierce resistance the three ruling siblings of the hive and all those that would follow as ascendants 
thereafter would hold enough power to be nearly unassailable they would be a Scourge upon the 
universe and for a time they looked Invincible that was until they faced the accum a starfaring 
Empire made seemingly of a conglomeration of many races one that might have some form of dark power 
of their own though this is hard to confirm as it is only spoken of in Whispers of LW recovered 
from one of the black pyramids thanks to the information obtained from the witness's own 
pyramid vessel we do know that the accum had built a Unity of Minds A Chorus constructed from 
the powers of Darkness but not one of evil one of harmonious thought together the accum were more 
than the hive had ever faced but they also had a helping hand a Krill matriarch called Tao she had 
been the original traitor who schemed to depose their father the old osmium King she had been 
unable to kill those three siblings and when they had been reborn into the high of gods she would 
flee the surface of fundament towards the ammonite and eventually towards deep space she would find 
find her way out into the reaches of the void and would be picked up by the accum forces she gave 
them practically all the intelligence they would need to break the hive's offensive and break 
it the accum did their great fleets pushed the hive Back Time After Time and they targeted and 
overkilled Alx savathun and Zorra wherever they appeared on the battlefield in time they might 
have been successful and might have wiped one of the witness's useful tools from the surface 
of the universe but this success would prove to be fleeting at best convening within Al's Throne 
World The Hive Gods discussed how to defeat the accum this discussion led to a simple conclusion 
one should claim the power of the others thus Alx killed seor wrath and savathun claiming their 
power by the logic of the sword he used this power to confront one of his own Gods ARA the worm 
of Secrets whom he killed in the name of knowledge with this alrix learned of The Secret of communing 
with what he termed to be the deep it is presumed that this led to the first meeting between alrix 
and the witness although in truth it isn't clear who alri spoke to there is a difference 
discernable to those that read the books of Sorrow an inconsistency between the approach 
of the witness and the approach of whatever being spoke to alrix in the darkness what is known is 
that alrix emerged empowered he had a command of powers beyond the comprehension of the accum alrix 
was no more he had returned as orx the taken King and he had learned the power to abduct beings 
through portals into another place where his enemies would be hollowed out by malicious forces 
and could be returned to the battlefield as THS under or's command these were the first taken and 
though orx would be called the taken King there would be many who would come to wield them in time 
the witness rol savathun Zorra see seemingly the only requirement to wield the taken was a strong 
enough will to impose upon them for the taken are but husks free of meaning and purpose until one 
is indwelled within them by a greater force and thus orx commanded them he would unleash the taken 
upon the accum and his campaign would conjure back his siblings by embodying their different penants 
where he was one of Slaughter and War he would back zeor wrath and in the aum's last moments 
where he tricked them into a Fool's Gambit he would embody his sister savathun thus all three 
Hive gods were returned and with Newfound Powers orex would go on to conquer more worlds and would 
raise four Wicked Offspring croa The Light eater aak the unraveler orano the Weaver and nois 
whose name would be struck from the world's grave and who would one day come to be known as 
a heretic through his children orx would extend his own power as all his children would tithe 
destruction to him but they would be storied villains unto themselves Uruk and ahak were the 
fabled creators of the oversoul and the Death Song destructive tools within the hiv's Arsenal 
that are still in use to this day it was zor's Sons though that would be the most stored albeit 
not for the reasons one might Define as productive nois who was weak of body but strong of Mind 
sought out hidden Apocrypha that might Grant him forgotten power this led him to the worm 
gods and in particular zul who was weaker than his siblings and sought an alliance for the sake 
of his own Survival zul promised nocis a power that was forbidden to the in exchange for loyalty 
servitude and his very heart the power that zul gifted nocis was necromancy one must understand 
though death is the realm of the hive necromancy is a power that is beyond offensive to them death 
to the hive is a sacred thing indicative of one's place within the universe of one's standing before 
the final perfect shape life is for the living for the strong and death is the fate of all those 
that are not strong enough to continue existing to return a being to life after its true and final 
death was seen as a great heresy this was not the same as the return of savathun or Zorra who fed 
upon the bounties of trickery and war that orx had conjured this was not the return of any ascendant 
who had tricked death and become strong enough to defy the laws of causality and build their own 
Throne world this was an Abomination the weak had been given a second chance it was unacceptable 
for this crime nocis was banished and all memory of him would be stripped from the great archives 
of the hive known as the world's grave all record of him was destroyed all trace of his story wiped 
clean only one Statue obstinate in its permanence was left standing near the altar of orex but 
the trace of or's Second Son aside from this would all be gone but nocis would live on past 
his banishment his Chronicles would be told when we returned one day to Mars but not before of 
or's first son though there would still be many Chronicles one day as croo was attempting to learn 
alongside his two sisters he would unwittingly be tricked by savathun and would allow the Vex to 
invade his father's Throne World a Vex Mind by the name of quaria would arrive to learn from the 
battle and quickly observing The Hive it deduced that within or's domain it was the sword logic 
and veneration of it that made one truly powerful thus it established a foothold in the heart of 
the hive's power by killing the hive themselves it had established it itself within or's Throne 
by or's own laws but it was still a causal being as all the facts are and when orex returned and 
blunted the offensive it was croa who would bear the blame he took croa and flung him into the 
Vex gate Network saying come home glorious or die forgotten and to these words croa would hold 
he would become a legendary demon and would lead his brood to Slaughter countless worlds in his 
father's name dedicating secret temples to him and learning much of the brutality that his father 
would impose upon the world venerating it in time but cot's actions had exposed the weakness in 
oro's own Throne World in response orex decided that the solution would be to combine his pocket 
Dimension with a massive Hive vessel in real space thus orx took the corpse of the worm God Ara and 
used its hide to create the baleful armoring that would encapsulate his throne world the dreadn a 
massive vessel whose construction was technically a paradox when orex placed his throne world into 
the dread nort it overlapped an ascendant plane pocket with real space this place should not 
exist but the power of orx was so great that he could indeed create a paradox that would be 
his great Fortress orx would then vengefully hunt down all those that were in a front to him 
and would eventually find the VX mind that had invaded his throne world when quaria the blade 
transform fought orx it stood no chance he took it and eventually would gift its taken remnants 
to savathun In This Moment orx should have been truly ascendant for as he had invaded and found 
the Vex it was amongst the fleet of the harmony the next who had been blessed by the Traveler's 
light it had lied to their worlds and now they stood within the gravity of a singularity except 
it had been paused and the worlds were living in a flourishing light The Hive had found these worlds 
and were soon to tear them down root and stem The Hive had become so powerful orx in particular that 
he would constrain the growth of all other things in the universe including savathun and zeor wrath 
and so the three divided before as a United Force they could have stood and destroyed the whole 
universe but savathun and zeu arath took their Broods and became distant needing space to grow 
and to change into something more powerful thus orx was alone and his sisters were split from 
him his swarm had made an indelible mark on the universe and had helped to serve the witness's 
purpose they had pursued The Traveler and had destroyed those that stood in the witness's path 
but now orex was alone now all the hive gods were alone in this they had shown their one possible 
weakness but to the witness itself this was of little concern The Hive were nothing but tools 
after all and they knew little of the true nature of the final shape as the witness devised it but 
they would soon serve a purpose in fulfilling its completion it was in this way that the hive and 
the taken king would descend Upon A Distant World belonging to an alien people a peaceful planet 
of Artisans Weavers dancers and technologically inclined priests it was here that they found 
the elix and their home world of Reese and like a great storm they would ravage this place 
and the traveler would once again be forced to flee the hiv's Rampage Across the Universe would 
bring them into contact with many peoples and many worlds their swarms were vast and as orex savathun 
and Zorra had all split they had now covered different ground or's brood remained the most 
powerful arm and their people would find another world seeded by The Traveler these were the people 
of Reese the elix though Humanity would one day come to know them first as the Fallen sourc from 
the alix's own histories indicate that they held a small number of colonies throughout several 
celestial bodies the heart of their civilization the jewel of their small Empire that spanned a 
few Stars was still set upon their home planet of Reese they were a Hardy but adaptable people 
they would be sustained by a life-giving substance called ether the exact chemical makeup of this 
compound is unfamiliar and unclear but it can be created by a servator from almost any Remnant 
matter meaning that the elix would be able to live on in almost any place so long as they had a 
servator however in the skies of their home World Reese this lifegiving compound was everywhere 
it filled the very air and turned their Sky a delicate shade of pink it allowed the elix to 
grow to their true natural sizes they would be between 7 and 10 ft tall they had six limbs four 
arms instead of just two they were dextrous and they were Nimble but they could also Stand Tall 
with Noble intent and philosophy back before Calamity arrived at their Shores the elix were 
in many ways a truly utopian people one of the best examples of what the traveler could do in the 
right circumstances their society was communal in nature and its people were organized into Noble 
houses known best not for their nationality but for their disciplines for example those that would 
one day be known as the house of wolves were known in that time as gentle Weavers great Artisans who 
would craft beautiful garments worn by all their people when the traveler arrived and exalted their 
civilization like the thousands it had uplifted before the elix developed entering a rapturous age 
of peace and expansion beneath Reese's pink sky the elix grew to exalt The Traveler and all 
lifegiving machines they came to call it the great machine and their study of its Divine construction 
would lead to the rise of the so-called splicers whilst we would know them better as biohackers and 
body Engineers the principal concern of splicers was in fact the study of Machinery itself the 
elix believed that within all machines there was a spark of divine potential and believed 
that within that Divine spark life itself could also be seen in some different somewhat more 
intangible form eventually the elix would see this belief morph into a worship of Machinery 
itself with them acting with great reverence to machines that they would construct later in their 
society machines that they would need to keep them alive alas even with the many noble houses 
the elix were doomed to suffer the same fate as all those blessed by The Traveler for its Bounty 
was followed by bitterness and the black fleets in the service of the witness would soon arrive 
the exact details of the fall of the elix Empire and in particular the fall of Reese are not well 
known much like our own destruction the event is known to the elix by another name the worldwind 
when ruin came to their system they were crushed beneath the advancing hordes of the witness's 
minions Chief amongst these Invaders would be the hive or's swarm had arrived his forces brought 
with them the same Doom that they had brought to a thousand worlds prior to them Reese was but 
another set of unbelievers to be delivered onto the jaws of death in the name of the sword Logic 
the houses mustered in a defense of their home World believing that in spite of all the darkness 
fate might be on their side but tragically it was not elix Legends tell of the moment where the 
defense of their world was lost when one of the great leaders that rallied them chelchis the 
Kell of the house of stone stood before the mo and cried where is the Great machine for it 
was in this moment that the course of history repeated itself once more and the traveler began 
to flee Reese away from the forces of the witness in that moment seeing that it had abandoned 
their people and that Reese was lost many would lose hope many would be scarred forever many 
would remember for scribes like VAR it would represent the greatest tragedy that his people had 
ever seen for warriors like Aramis it represented a betrayal so bitter and so evil that it would 
create hatred lasting for thousands of years but for one amongst their number it created a moment 
of determination that defined an entire people seeing that the traveler the great machine had 
abandoned their people and that Reese was lost the kale of the house that would one day be known as 
the house of devils told his forces to break off from the engaging attackers he ordered his ship to 
pursue the traveler with all haste and all catches under his command were to follow this order 
this Kell who would one day claim the name of ailu abandoned all those houses who could not make 
war and in his pursuit of the great machine many others followed him thousands of Alix on thousands 
of catches would begin the long Exodus from Reese Chasing The Traveler following aol's Banner an 
exodus that would come to be known as the long drift some houses gathered in groups of catches 
some followed the trail of the great machine alone but no matter what it would be a time of terrible 
hardship having left their home World Behind the elix had little of the lifegiving substance known 
as ether to consume they needed to construct new machines to create ether synthetically and so the 
cators were created they were made spherical in shape perhaps to venerate The Traveler whilst the 
ctors could make ether out of any abandoned matter that was discovered the scarcity of resources in 
deep space led to the Devolution of Alix Society the once noble people became Pirates scavengers 
and Warlords barbaric practices became commonplace there was not enough ether to go around those 
few that could get enough were the leaders of the houses because they were strong they claimed 
the position of Kels and those amongst them of religious inclinations would commune with the 
cators and thus the Triad of power within each house was born the Kels the archons and the 
cators a new hierarchy had been born from the broken remains of the old where before the��
elex had grown tall now the Kels would become monstrous in size as they consumed more than 
their fair share of ether to remain stronger still with their utterly monstrous strength there 
was less chance of them being challenged by rivals for most though rationing would be the way 
of their life those without sufficient ether remained small stunted and weak worst of all 
though the punishments dled out by those who ruled became harsh to the point of being almost 
unspeakable it is likely that on the long drift the barbaric practice of severing an alix's lower 
arms became a commonplace punishment for failure this would be known as docking and many who 
ad doed were turned into drags or wretches the lowest possible wrong of elix society thus it 
was that the elix would pursue the traveler and become less of a people than their history would 
allow them to remember the once Noble banners of their houses would be cannibalized into symbols 
of dominance and Declarations of territory they would no longer be the utopian people that had 
grown up beneath the great machine the damage to their societal fabric was so great that 
it would permeate through generations there would be newborn Alex but they would mostly be 
born in a time where few of them would remember the Whirlwind or Reese they had no home to call 
their own it would be nothing more than a passing Legend a dream it came to the point that when 
Humanity named them Fallen as a common slur and reference to their status as a people abandoned 
by The Traveler many amongst the elix need did not completely reject the notion they were a 
lost people a tragic tale a diaspora of vessels and cultures and longlived memories but should 
the universe be so harsh could have been snuffed out in an instance they would continue onwards and 
would follow the trail of the traveler to the next system that it had blessed that would take some 
time and there were other civilizations who would make their way to our astral Shores for reasons 
other than Vengeance and Reclamation there were those that would make their way to our Shores 
in the name of Empire and conquest and they too would be making moves even though the traveler 
and the witness had never laid eyes on them whilst many civilizations throughout the Universe 
would be uplifted by the traveler there were some that made their own way into the stars without the 
divine intervention or assistance from a greater being one such people was found on the distant 
and rugged world of Torah ble they were known as the cabal and their society was one ruled by 
might in their earliest years Mighty Warlords would roam their world claiming the right to 
territory by conquest and combat even in the days when they would break out into the Stars the 
cabal's great Warlords would still challenge each other for Supremacy in the rights of their old 
ways it is perhaps then unsurprising that one of the oldest Legends of the cabal is one that 
concerns their first emperor a mythical figure called acrius the cabal once saw the sun and 
desired it for themselves so they climbed a great Mountain to claim it but before they could 
reach the sun to claim it a great Beast stood in their way generations of Mighty and worthy 
Warriors clashed against the Beast scoring small and seemingly insignificant blows against it until 
one day acrius came and struck the killing blow he ascended to claim the son and was crowned as the 
first emperor of the cabal this Legend shows their lack of subtlety as a people but it also has been 
a literal pretext for Conquest the cabal believe themselves to be righteous rulers in this universe 
and they believe that it is so because they are mightier than their foes the sun is Theirs to 
Claim because they are strong enough and so they claim it the legend of acaras may or may not be 
true but the Emperors of the cabal have been very real and across their history they laid claim 
to dozens of Worlds some of these worlds were occupied by peoples that would be folded into the 
cabal Empire the synu the kaga clips the arkborn the Scions all of them would have at some point 
been client races of the cabal of torab battle and would be pushed into slavery and servitude 
of their Emperors the history of the cabal is a long long one full of many conquests made by 
tyrants but none of these despots and Warlords have been more consequential than one who changed 
the fabric of their society so much that it led to his own downfall his name was Emperor callus and 
while he was Emperor he was not truly powerful in the time when his Reign began he would need 
to upend institutions for it to truly flourish as Emperor he served alongside other powerful 
bodies that governed much of Torah battle's strength their people were ruled by a senate 
and their military by a ptor the old military traditions of the cabal were maintained but 
callus was different he did not care for them he was content with the idea of Conquest but he 
was not a marshall cabal he sought song and beauty and pleasure in in all things and the ptor stood 
in the way of this the Senate stood in the way so callus created a populist Revolution to overthrow 
them both so that he might claim ultimate authority over his own Empire callus changed the 
cabal people fundamentally when he rose to power his populism saw the warlike ways of the cabal 
relegated in favor of a bountiful and hedonistic culture even at his coronation the nature of his 
rule was made clear as he had the desert sands of torab Bartle cleansed to be pristine and white 
having his army of minions remove every single offending stone or plant that might stand out and 
for his entire Royal Court to be recreated in the Sands of torab bartel's deserts more telling were 
the actions he took upon his coronation itself though as the one true ruler of the cabal in the 
Splendor of his perfectly recreated Royal Court callus had the old conso of the prorat brought 
before him stripped of rank and title and even clothing callus castrated the cabal console and 
banished him into the wastelands of torab batle saying but a single word to him run this was an 
example of the ruthlessness with which callus governed his Imperial domain he was benevolent 
and generous one moment vengeful and Petty the next he treated the old cabal ways with contempt 
and uplifted new celebrations of culture and decadence but behind the New Emperor's magnificent 
opulence there was a deep sadness this sadness was born of a love that he had lost his original 
lover had left him in a time of great sorrow callus knew that he had broken things between them 
and that despite loving her their relationship had been damaged Beyond repair all thanks to his own 
selfish actions but there was one spark of that relationship that still remained one remnant of 
his old flame that he clung to together they had created an heir to the cabal Empire her name 
would be kitle as she grew in his new cabal Empire she perhaps did not first comprehend the 
changes to her people's proud ways she did not not originally hate her father though it would 
not take long for her to have good reason to do so one day her father doted on her as he had done 
before he had given her some of the most revered gifts that a cabal could receive but today he had 
surpassed even himself he gifted his daughter a war Beast these War beasts in cabal culture are 
the most extreme example of what it's like for a human being to own and lovingly care for a dog 
they are venerated Beyond exception and are some of the most prized companion animals that a cabal 
can have kitle named her War Beast Milos and loved it dearly beyond anything else in the world callus 
saw Kyle's love for the war beast and in his inconceivable cruelty and jealousy he grew jealous 
of Milos he believed that she loved her own War Beast more than she loved him and so callus had 
Milos killed he could not stand the idea of his daughter loving even a pet more than him this 
moment changed kitle and set her down a path that would determine the course of her life forever 
she now held a burning hatred for her father that was so deep in the kernel of her heart that 
it would never be dislodged and she was certainly not alone there were many within Call's Empire 
that saw him with a degree of discontent title was but one of them the emperor's old bodyguard 
lior shet the evocate general and Primus of all his Legions amarra the Freeborn Sion dreamer known 
as OT the master of festivals moly imoli all of them harbored eill intent for the emperor but it 
was under the leadership of two cabal that these malcontent actors would be Al Ed in purpose and 
turned into conspirators the former Consul that callus had banished into the desert and his chosen 
Champion the rising gladiatorial leader that had emerged victorious in the fighting pits the ghost 
Primus of the red Legion Gaul these conspirators joined together and plotted to overthrow callus a 
plot that would come to be known as the midnight coup each of them would play their own part in his 
downfall but it was kitle who spelled his ultimate Doom as the midnight coup was being enacted callus 
fled for his throne room he sought a relic of the Emperors of old A Shard of bone taken from a wish 
Dragon the remains of these mythical creatures were known to Grant desires to those that held 
them with the shard in hand callus might be able to maintain his hold on power if only he wished 
for it but when he arrived kitle was already present in the throne room she held The Shard of 
wish dragon bone in her hand knowing that she held her father's salvation kitle addressed him saying 
father I will not be weak she crushed the bone in her Gauntlet and with it sealed Call's fate he was 
escorted hurriedly through the streets of the kab Capital his utterly massive Entourage in tow 
all traces of the old Emperor save for those that were part of his coup would be scrubbed 
from the Imperial hierarchy they were all forced to March aboard a cabal vessel known as 
the Leviathan and callus was forced into Exile the navigation controls for this great vessel were 
sabotaged and the emperor was left to drift into Uncharted space on Toro battle the consul and 
Gaul SE seed power and began a new era for the cabal the former Primus of the red Legion would 
be declared as the very first and only Dominus of the cabal an emperor and Military dictator Allin 
one his power over the Empire would be absolute and with the prise of all Legions amarra and the 
air apparent to the Imperial Throne kitle at his side his authority was unchallenged Emperor callus 
would wallow in pity and sorrow for a Time aboard the Leviathan his cohort of scribes recorded that 
there was nothing that could be done to break him from his misery no form of entertainment no food 
no pleasure would Rouse him from this sorrow the exact amount of time the emperor spent like this 
is not recorded but what eventually broke him from his stuper would be one day as the Leviathan 
sailed through the Uncharted void of space it encountered strange interference the nature of 
this interference would not be known at first based on our explorations of similar events and 
based on Call's own Recollections it is almost certain that he encountered the black Fleet what 
he would come to know as the black Edge he would see the witness the pocket of Astral disruption 
that they found themselves in caused massive Quakes throughout the Leviathan and callus put 
put on an environmental suit to see what had befallen the vessel from its own Hull out on the 
exterior of the Leviathan callus beheld that thing that he would be defined by for the rest of his 
life he would see the witness and it told callus that there was to be an end to all things and that 
the Universe would end by its glorious design and that he was to be its Herald after 12 hours and 
numerous terrible quakes callus returned inside with a look of Mania in his eyes he had first 
openly proclaimed the Doom of the universe and then with a sigh of what seemed to be relief he 
welcomed it as he said at the time when nothing matters what's left Joy Comfort Freedom the true 
freedom of pursuing pleasure for pleasure's sake because it pleases you because you desire it I 
knew this during my rule and I'd forgotten it during my Exile I shall not forget it again 
thus callus returned to his helenistic ways with a renewed Vigor and a new Mission he would 
follow the directions of this terrible voice and would be its Herald at first he would also aim to 
acquire his revenge against those that had wronged him to this end the leviathan's navigation systems 
were returned to functioning order and the vessel charted its way back to known space callus would 
start to actively employ some of his deadliest servants in the task of seeking Revenge his 
Shadows across the many worlds that had been conquered by the emperor of the cabal he had found 
individuals of incredible martial skill they were brought to callus contained in glorious armor 
embellished with gold and heraldry and offered all that their hearts desired in exchange for 
servitude unending callus would send his Shadows after the conspirators and managed to successfully 
hunt down the Master of Ceremonies Call's former bodyguard and a favored Tea Merchant that he had 
once believed to have served ghoul's Command Staff these were but the first attempted assassinations 
and upon Gaul and kitle there would be many for his daughter in particular he would send Shadows 
with a specific weapon in hand a blade that had been passed down from generation to generation 
the heart Shadow forged from a rare metal called inactin this weapon could not be broken it would 
always reform to its original shape if But A Shard of it was exposed to cionic energy and the 
memory of what it had been like the weapon was an heirloom passed through the women of Call's line 
and he had made sure that kitle would eventually receive the weapon one way or another his ass 
assassins attempted to take her life time and time again and each time the Mighty air apparent 
would leave the blade shattered ready to be reforged by callus once again in a strange way 
this is how they kept in touch callus and kitle would not communicate directly but every time a 
new Assassin came wielding the blade kitle would shatter it in these reflections of each other's 
choices did kitle and callus know of each other's continued existence it was the only way to gauge 
each other's strength and intention assassins would be sent to kill Gaul and the consul but 
likewise they would fail the new ruler of the cabal had set his sights on further Horizons he 
had remilitarized the culture of torob batle and had sent out many of the Scout Legions of the 
Empire to systems at the far reaches of cabal space each sent under a banner of war with a 
promise without victory they would be exiled and could not return home gul's forces would chart 
their way through the universe and would one day find themselves on the route to Saul five Scout 
Legions and an elite group of Sion flayers would one day land upon the shores of Saul's planets 
but just as the Vex And Hive and Alix would it would take them time before any of them arrived 
in Saul came an omen of prosperity and doom a single event that would change the course of 
human history for all time and all people here is where Humanity's part in this Story begins 
and it starts with the arrival of The Traveler at last our tale turns to humanity who at the 
time were A Primitive civilization but even by the standards of most we had accomplished a 
few Marvels in our time the creation of human culture and language the splitting of the atom 
the Journey of a few brave souls into space but it was in the early 2010s that the world held its 
breath as a signal was detected from our closest planetary neighbor of Mars something remarkable 
was happening the world was changing and perhaps most shockingly of all it did not seem to be 
a natural phenomenon the events taking place on Mars defied scientific explanation hastily the 
three great greatest powers on Earth at the time assembled a Joint Task Force the United States of 
America Russian Federation and People's Republic of China joined forces to send an astronaut tyona 
and Cosmonaut to Mars to investigate the mission would be known originally as project catamaran 
but it would be remembered in history as Aries 1 and so it was that on a fateful day in the year 
of 2014 the Explorers M over Chia and Hardy became the first humans to step out onto the surface of 
another planet they were unsure of what they might find when they arrived and whilst all hoped for 
a peaceful encounter they had been armed in case of a hostile event across mountainous terrain and 
through uncharacteristic Martian winds they treed toward the signal Source anticipation building 
with their every step as they crested the ridge they saw it the source of the signal and the 
reason for the disturbances together they beheld The Entity that would change the fate of humanity 
Forever The Traveler beneath its radiant Splendor they bore witness to the first Martian Reigns 
in human history and saw life return to the red planet but this was not simply the greatest 
discovery in all of human history it was the start of a time of great prosperity for all the 
people of Earth just like it had been for so many civilizations before this time would be known 
to us as the Golden Age like the thousands that had come before us the traveler gifted Humanity 
with the lights Bounty of creation the changes to humanity were apparent almost immediately the 
nations of Earth and all its peoples entered a time of utopian peace and prosperity with the 
Bounty of the traveler affected L doing away with all forms of war and Prejudice the lifespan 
of the average human tripled and we did not grow frail in our old age those at the age of 90 were 
considered relatively young and highly capable it is recorded that back in the days of the Golden 
Age there were humans born with a remarkable gift they were able to hear the voice of the traveler 
through involuntary dreams and sudden premonitions they were known as the dreamers and would one day 
come to be known as speakers and their words were observed with reverence and respect we expanded 
out into the system of soul and established marvelous colonies an Endeavor made easier by 
The Traveler which had begun to terraform our worlds into hospitable planets Mercury became a 
garden world and the Bread Basket of the system Venus turned into a lush planet of jungles and 
rivers Titan was given a breathable atmosphere alongside its oceans of methane Humanity expanded 
out to all these places and more as the traveler changed the worlds around us from hellscapes 
into Havens great cities Rose from these formerly inhospitable places from the marvels of 
the archaeologies of Titan to the spires of the Martian city of Freehold Humanity took root and 
flourished in Saul many inst institutions grew on to take power the most renowned of them 
being the thriving new technology firms and research groups that had set up throughout 
the system there was the Ishtar Collective who were primarily based on Venus where they had 
discovered the veex ruins that predated Humanity by billions of years their study of the Vex would 
bring about the creation of technological Marvels and new understandings all in their own right 
then there was probably the most most infamous Corporation to ever have existed in the Golden 
Age whose Legacy can be found scattered across the system to this day the Clovis Bray Corporation 
named after its less than humble Creator Clovis Bray the first it was responsible for starting 
entire research and development colonies as well as sponsoring scientific innovation in countless 
areas from artificial intelligence to artificial personhood to Aerospace defense the remnants 
of clov facilities can still be found across sa from Earth to the Moon to Mars and even on 
some distant Jovian moons they were known to work in collaboration with certain National 
governments as well and held a great deal of power and influence across all of humanity 
but perhaps the greatest Legacy of Humanity's golden age was our technology in the Golden Age 
we saw the rise of New Creations that might have seemed indistinguishable from even magic to those 
living back in the early 21st century Humanity quickly developed space fairing craft capable of 
remarkable Feats of Transportation including the first near light speed jump drives there was also 
the creation of glimmer a programmable matter that could be turned into almost anything imaginable 
when used in combination with the correct energy sources and the correct matter Forge in a very 
similar vein but on a grander scale Willer Bray one of clovis's granddaughters was a leading 
Pioneer on a project known as sver this was a nanite technology that could be commanded 
to construct and create anything conceivable so long as it was given the correct inputs and 
control the speed with which these nanites could construct something from seemingly nothing was 
revolutionary there are some who speculate that the great cities of the Golden Age colonies were 
built so quickly thanks partly to this technology it could even convert surrounding matter into 
more sver allowing it to replicate quickly it was intended to be used in deep space colonization 
missions as well to allow for the creation of anything from basic habitation structures to whole 
colonies in next to no time at all there was also the discovery of a new more pure state of matter 
engram within this state of matter information and energy could be stored and encoded with 
near perfect precision and whilst it would Decay over time ingrams became as reasonable a 
means to store data as any other they were in fact significant data stores and can still often 
be found in the wild decrypted and materialized into whatever is contained within as long as you 
have the appropriate skill of crypto archaeology but undoubtedly there were two inventions within 
the golden age that were more remarkable than any others the exos and the war mind exos were merely 
theoretical for a long time the idea was a simple one a human consciousness stored digitally on 
a mechanical body thus allowing the person to live on with immortality inside their mechanical 
shell it became the obsession of Clovis Bray the first who desired immortality and believed that he 
would be the one to guide Humanity into a second age of man where they would surpass even The 
Traveler exomes had been created before in the Golden Age by others but they had universally 
failed falling prey to fundamental flaws that saw the spark of the human mind dim and go out 
every time the first hint to the secret of true exos was discovered on the moon a project under 
the watchful eye of clovis's grandson Alton Bray had uncovered something terrible but powerful the 
so-called K1 project had discovered an artifact buried on the moon it was known as the anomaly and 
had inexplicable properties but Chief amongst them was a series of hallucinations and Nightmares 
suffered by the crew Clovis visited the site and whilst others experienced hallucinations he 
heard something entirely different a voice that guided him to the distant Moon of Europa promising 
in his dreams that he would discover the secret to his Ascension his entire purpose and reason 
for creating the exos there Clovis discovered what he would call Clarity control a statue 
of a tall veiled figure beneath the moon's icy crust this would be the first of many statues 
of the darkness that we would find always veiled always black as obsidian and always brimming with 
dark power thanks to the Visions he had received he also divined that he would need to construct a 
Vex gate the combination of these two factors was key to the axo creation Vex radiolarian fluid or 
mind fluid exposed to the influence of the veiled statue was the key to the creation of a stable 
exom mind fluid at a sight that would be known as the deepstone Crypt a mass of exos would emerge 
and begin to trickle down into Human Society at Large little did Clovis know that the K1 artifact 
and Clarity control were fueled by darkness and that Clovis might have played into the grander 
designs of Agents Beyond his comprehension the war mind was the other invention of Clovis Bray that 
might have defined the golden age but whilst his granddaughter Elsie Bray would have been close to 
the EXO project it was Anna Bray who was close to this one the war mind was a cre ation that would 
eventually supersede Clover spray himself but it would be inaccurate to call the warind simply an 
AI the war mind was a super intelligence refined over years and given an unfathomable amount 
of processing power it is a super intelligence capable of far more than any administrative or 
defensive intelligence its original template had been derived from the Aries 1 mission where it 
was a smaller AI that had simply been nicknamed R it would now be given a new name under Clovis 
Bray and his granddaughter Anastasia Bray it would bear the name Rasputin Rasputin's systems were so 
vast that he would sometimes split himself into different subes in order to partition different 
tasks into different working groups in the age of the Guardians this even gave rise to the 
theory that there were many Great War mines of which Rasputin was the Great greatest Charlamagne 
malahayati Martel all of these ancient names that were once thought to be great virtual Defenders 
working in parallel under primes inap parz were in fact just parts of the singular warmind Rasputin 
even with this in mind they had their own thoughts and perspectives and they would name Rasputin 
according to his influence they gave him the Monica of the Tyrant Rasputin's man date as the 
warind was simple his purpose was to be Humanity's Shield protecting us from threats to our existence 
that might come from the Stars he was linked in with almost every possible piece of infrastructure 
to assist him with this goal every vessel every satellite every automated weapon system they 
could have all been commandeered by the warmind at a moment's notice should an emergency arise 
Rasputin even employed a small private Army of loyal human and EXO forces known as seraps where 
manual intervention was required they represented the long arm of the tyrants will whilst he 
lacked any paracausal abilities himself he still represented one of the most advanced intelligences 
ever created across the whole of existence as evidenced by a moment where his significant 
computational power was enough to overpower even a Vex and save an entire Ishtar Collective 
research team with this power Rasputin was capable of devising solutions to problems before they 
ever truly arose more often than not this would lead to the creation of remarkable weapons created 
through independent subprotocols of his own design this could be anything from traditional Small Arms 
such as was made in the eolos program or fullscale planetary defense systems the greatest of these 
weapons was undoubtedly the warsat network which was launched continually from Mars and which 
spread throughout the system each independent warsat held various sensors and communication 
systems and was also armed with a variety of ordinance packages Clovis spray the first would at 
one point plan on using these weapons packages to do the unthinkable in his hubris Clovis believed 
that he could replace the traveler with Rasputin and so he engineered the possibility for Rasputin 
to strike down the mysterious sphere a protocol called abhorent imperative was inserted into the 
War min's code allowing him the option to do just this should the traveler abandon Humanity this 
could have led to disaster but luckily Clovis Bray wasn't the only one working on the warmind 
his granddaughter Anastasia was concerned with Rasputin's capacity to understand the worth 
of humanity if Clovis Bray gave Rasputin his mind then it would be fair to say that Anastasia 
pre gave him his soul it was thanks to her many lessons that Rasputin would lock Clovis out of 
his systems realizing that abhorent imperative was something that he should probably never use whilst 
the protocol remained intact it would never be used by Rasputin even if Clovis had tried to force 
him to use it it would have failed Rasputin's love of human culture would be reflected even to the 
last of his dying moments if you ventured into his bunkers every once in a while you could 
hear chaikovsky playing in the background with all of Humanity's Newfound prosperity and its 
security all but guaranteed by the war mind we set our sights further a field this was the time in 
which a colonization program known as The Exodus program was conceived of dozens of massive Colony 
ships were constructed each packed with colonists and shipboard systems that but would Propel 
Humanity to the Stars Beyond Soul The Exodus vessels were designated by color such as Exodus 
red Exodus blue Exodus Indigo and exodus black under the supervision of General Chen lanu these 
vessels were assembled and launched from the old cosmodrome in bonor Kazakhstan and negotiations 
with Clovis Bray were even undertaken to see sea nanites placed aboard each vessel to assist with 
ization efforts or defense should the need arise the Golden Age and all of its Prosperity had been 
a great Boon to humanity but as history has shown us this time of Peace was not to last there were 
signs that it would one day come to an end but most Unfortunately they were almost universally 
ignored by humanity and even as Rasputin quickly moved to counter the oncoming threat it was 
readily apparent that there was little that could be done to Halt the coming storm Humanity 
like so many before would experience an apocalypse that was all too familiar to those blessed with 
the Traveler's light the forces of the witness were on the March and the black Fleet loomed on 
the edges of our system we would be powerless to stop what happened next the end of the Golden 
Age had finally come the collapse had begun though Humanity had a few moments at which there 
were warning signs hinting towards the nature of the coming collapse and even some direct warnings 
themselves many times they were tragically ignored pushed to the side due to huus or simply a lack of 
believing that the Golden Age could ever end after all it was so easy to believe that Humanity would 
never be toppled from the height of its power but just like every civilization before topple we 
did and this time the whole of the system would be plunged into terrible Darkness like so many 
others though the collapse might have happened quickly it was not a single moment in time that 
turned the marvels of our golden age from Splender to Ash there were warning signs long before this 
and the months over which the collapse seemingly took place would have been brutal playing host to 
countless tragedies but our warnings would begin on Titan the Proto worm God Assa sole survivor of 
fundament had made her home in the methane ocean viscous depths there she had stayed alone for eons 
until the traveler arrived in the new Pacifica archology was founded on the ocean surface above a 
subsurface research team eventually found ARA and she reached out to them with harmonious psychic 
resonance she wished for friendship to break the loneliness that she had felt for so many eons but 
she also uttered Dreadful warnings the Marines xenobiologist who studied ARA heard her warnings 
and even brought them to their superiors but alas the ancient warning of the single being that 
might have told them of the witness fell on death ears thus our first chance to avert complete 
disaster was scuppered on Mars there was another opportunity a joint venture between the Clovis 
Bray Corporation and the Ishtar Collective had borne significant fruit rout and would be the 
next Avenue by which we might have learned of the oncoming Calamity and done something about it 
by utilizing Vex technology discovered on Venus and in cooperation with Clover prey a new AI was 
created it was not as powerful as Rasputin but it was still worthy of great respect her name 
was soteria but she was also known by another designation the org mind the Vex technology at 
the heart of ata's construction allowed her to be free of the Vex Collective whilst retaining 
their remarkable computational and simulation abilities in particular the acquired Vex ability 
to simulate the future with uncanny degrees of accuracy was what sataria had maintained the Vex 
commonly used this power to chart a course to the end state of the universe where they will be 
the only remaining form of life that will survive uncontested sataria used to this technology to 
chart safe routes for Colonial Expeditions out Beyond even the reaches of the Milky Way one 
day the fabled Ishtar Collective leader known as Maya sundaresh removed soteria from suspension 
and asked her to run a few tests namely to chart safe courses for Colonial Echo pods heading 
from Saul to the andrometer Galaxy sataria initially calculated over 300 preliminary routes 
as she calculated those routs in real time her Advanced algorithms recalculated first down from 
300 to 27 and then moments later to just two these realtime calculations were due to the presence of 
unknown anomalous variables that presented a near 100% chance of total casualties on all Colonial 
flights salaria didn't know it at the time but she had just simulated and discovered CED the black 
Fleet and had realized that it was on its way any potential Colonial flights that might Escape 
had a narrow window in which they would need to do so for the fleet was getting closer to Saul 
with every second so teria shephered this data to Rasputin on a private Communications band and 
classified the threat under the subtext code of Rasputin's own designation known as Egyptian a 
Threat Level used to define a force that defied all causal explanation and that might be capable 
of the extinction level threat that Rasputin was always working to counter Rasputin agreed with 
the assessment and prepared for allout war in the system soteria for her part was responsible 
for at least one attempt to save the lives of what human colonists were prepared to go beyond 
Soul she prepared emergency launches for the fleet of colonial Echo Pods at her disposal and 
attempted to send them out in a desperate Gambit to avoid the oncoming storm glovis Bray saw 
her actions and immediately reprimanded her believing she had gone Rogue the echo pods were 
returned to their docking posts and soteria was confined to an AI Piller bunker on Mars a prison 
for an artificial intelligence a prison that was originally meant for the warmind Rasputin this 
was a punishment for her defiance in a moment of desperation sataria attempted one last thing she 
tried to create a submind sending out a fragment of herself as data reaching into space a last 
ditch effort to save herself and warn Humanity but it would be too little too late and even with 
Rasputin having been warned there was nothing that could be done to stop the greatest catastrophe 
in human history we had been given two chances to heed the warnings of the oncoming collapse 
through a combination of hubris inaction and misunderstanding we had wasted them and so the 
black Fleet arrived so the collapse began so the witness's forces began to put Saul to the torch 
the first public alerts that something had gone wrong came from Rasputin he sounded General 
evacuation orders across the outer colonies millions of people from Titan to Mars prepared to 
leave on distant Exodus program vessels new orders were relayed to ship captains they were to make 
an about turn and use their defensive systems as orbital artillery within Soul these orders were 
briefly questioned but most would follow them not all though and even if they had all followed 
them it was not going to be enough the next sign came to be the most distressing of them all the 
traveler which had only partially conducted the terraforming of Jupiter's volcanic moon of IO was 
on the move once more this was not unheard of the traveler would routinely move from planetoid 
to planetoid terraforming them for Humanity to colonize but this time its work was incomplete 
and it wasn't heading for a new patch of ground to transform it was heading directly for Earth the 
reason for this retreat was unknown to humanity at the time but it was likely the same reason for 
The Travelers Retreat time and time again the forces of Darkness had arrived the Broods of the 
hive had arrived the black Fleet had arrived the witness's forces were here its Advance across Saul 
was a tide of death in some ways quite literally whilst those in the many Colony ships that 
reached the outer system were wiped out almost universally by gravitational weapons from the 
black Fleet nowhere was there more dramatic end than on Titan where the black Fleet artificially 
altered the moon's gravity to create a 150t high wave a super tsunami that spread out across the 
oceans of Titan and shattered The Archies beneath a torrant of methane the warm mind fought back 
against the witness's fleet but even with all its power there was nothing it could do the vessels 
of the black Fleet had technology and paracausal power beyond anything the war could have prepared 
for including fields that teleported weapons away into a separate pocket of Dimension just before 
they could impact the vessel any rounds fired at a pyramid ship even to this day experienced this 
same phenomenon the war mind struggled and buckled against the black Fleet and it was seemingly left 
with little choice in a moment of desperation realizing there was only one way it could survive 
Rasputin did the unthinkable Rasputin Shrugged off his duties disconnecting himself from his 
planetary Network and splitting himself into dozens of desperate fragments in hundreds of 
installations in an act that he would live to regret more than any other on any day Rasputin 
abandoned Humanity to their fate and chose to live to fight in the future in this moment as the 
forces of the witness gathered other Interlopers were making their moves the exiled of Prince nocis 
and his worm God Patron Z had decided that they would descend upon Saul and planned to claim the 
planet of Mars for themselves they descended upon helis Basin where the war mines core was located 
in response to these Interlopers Rasputin could do something they were not the black Fleet and 
despite their power being immense Rasputin was able to respond against these Interlopers Rasputin 
deployed a defense system that flash froze nocis zul and the entire brood of Hive that had followed 
in their wake suction action would not only have the effect of creating an artificial ice cap 
on Mars but it also suspended the war mind worm God and Hive prince in stasis none of them 
would be able to take part in the battles ahead and only when the ice caps again began to thw 
hundreds of years later would this new threat reemerge once more at the heart of the collapse 
Humanity would Suffer Without rutin but even if he had died in their defense it would have made 
no difference Humanity would die in their Untold billions the forces of the witness were Unleashed 
upon the worlds of sa survivors from the black Armory recall some of the moments of the great 
Calamity on Earth where the witness's forces cut down those in front of them that could not fight 
back without Mercy or remorse with the black Fleet destroyed all the satellites above in Earth's 
low orbit as a Titanic show of their power when a terrible great Mist was released upon Earth's 
surface which turned everything that touched it to nothing more than bone and dust the forces 
of the black Fleet were ascendant triumphant nothing would stop them as they slowly moved 
in and soon they would be ready to take the fight to the traveler above Earth soon they would 
make the the killing blow the traveler was there ready for the witness and its disciples to claim 
and here in this final moment they would finally be able to link the veil and the traveler and 
allow the completion of the final shape on one of the vessels of the black Fleet one of the 
witness's disciples had been selected for the great honor of leading the assault against Earth 
his name was nzar the so-called final God of pain his dark influence had invaded the dreams of 
a few who'd lived in Saul long before even the time of the Traveler's arrival and now he had 
come to this new dark feeding ground the veil was in his possession and from his vessel within 
the black Fleet he would tear Humanity aunder at their home world for this one terrible moment all 
must have seemed lost Humanity's outer colonies lay in ruin its great defendant all lay dead 
the escaping vessels were dashed against the black Fleet and its forces and yet in this moment 
most inexplicable turn of events would take place and it was all thanks to one who the witness had 
deceived long ago savathun the witch Queen after she had split from the taken King oro's side 
the witness had taken note of her cunning and her viciousness it had planned for her to to one 
day Ascend to the rank of disciple superseding even her brother orex in a move that sparked 
jealousy from R the first disciple the witness saw her as a potentially great asset perhaps 
it was despite Ral for his failers concerning the annihilation of a species called the Arid 
perhaps it was simply perceived as being the best use of resources whatever the case R's vessel 
had been grounded within savathun's Throne world and he was instructed to train her to one day 
Ascend into the witness's highest ranks in this moment of true Victory she was so close to 
finally achieving that station but savathun is cunning and she had her own plans zath had 
no intention of following the doctrine of the witness and completing the final shape perhaps 
it was because her existence was predicated on lies and deception that she was so easily able to 
fit in with its ranks perhaps she had learned the truth of the godwave and that the witness had 
lied to The Hive perhaps she wished to pursue a greater form of ascension all for herself 
whatever the case may be savathun did as she had previously done to orx when he was Alx with 
blade in hand she fought with nzar betraying him and defeating him it is not easy to definitively 
say that this is so but savathun might have used the innate power of the veil to overcome nzar 
regardless she did strike him down and above Earth she stole away the veil the key to the 
witness's plans before allowing nar's pyramid vessel to crash deep into the surface of Luna 
In This Moment The Butcher of 10 million Worlds the god of lies and deception the next in line 
to ascend into one of the witnesses most loyal disciples had scuppered its plans and robbed 
it of the final victory that it so desperately craved savathun would shepher the veil away to the 
planet of Neptune were a mixture of the planet's dense atmosphere interference from local Vex and 
the Haywire signal of the veil itself would be enough to hide it from the witness's prying eyes 
in orbit above one of the few remaining Colony ships Exodus Indigo carried the Ishtar Collective 
research known as masas Andes and Chom essi out of the chaos they were assaulted by a disciple 
of some kind but miraculously managed to fend it off with their ship's defenses the glaive of 
the disciple that had struck the vessel was used like an antenna and remarkably it picked up the 
remains of saria's wayward submind allowing it to safely Harbor within the vessel itself even 
as The Exodus Indigo would shuttle its way into Neptune's atmosphere they would find the veil thus 
many years later the hidden city of neomuna would be born but for the longest time both the veil 
and the city would be cloaked from the whole universe and none would know it would have been 
assumed quite easily that The Exodus Indigo was just another calamitous casualty of the collapse 
but in reality their survival represented the one true Hope For Humanity for here the tide had been 
turned Humanity's Doom was still all but assured but without the veil the witness could not enact 
its plans it could not merge the Traveler's light with the veil's darkness it could not create the 
final shape the details of what happened next are as vague and mythical as the traveler itself some 
believed that the war mind had indeed a attempted to destroy the traveler others believed that in a 
single Titanic battle the forces of Darkness were defeated by the forces of light others speak of 
stranger Tales still but what we do know is this the traveler sacrificed itself to save humanity 
and as it hung low above Earth it was left broken a massive Shard of the mysterious sphere can still 
be found as a remnant of that Titanic struggle it sits to this day in what is now known as the 
European Dead Zone the forces of the witness were either banished from Soul or left seeing that the 
traveler had sacrificed itself to save Humanity the black fleet was forcibly ejected into dark 
space or perhaps the witness left hibernating there just in case there was anything it could do 
to one day return and Achieve Victory but for now now the traveler had won but the cost was utterly 
staggering most of humanity lay dead or dying the war mind was nowhere to be found our great Marvels 
and technology and culture had been thrown into the fire our knowledge was lost and the ravages 
of Apocalypse were Upon Us worst of all the traveler which had given its last full measure of 
benevolence above Earth in the name of humanity was all but complete completely gone ruin was upon 
us but from this moment of tragedy A New Hope was born in the moment of the Traveler's sacrifice 
thousands of tiny Sparks of its own Divinity were released tiny autonomous drones no larger than 
a clenched fist spilled forth from the traveler this was the birth of the ghosts their like had 
never been seen before and they would change the fate of humanity and all those within the system 
once again their sacred Mission their singular task was to head out into the system to find those 
amongst the Dead who were worthy of wielding the Traveler's light and to resurrect them as its 
undying Warriors though they would be known as the Risen or lightbearers in the early days in the 
ages that followed they would almost universally be heralded by another title they would be known 
as the guardians but theirs was not the only light that would emerge after the collapse the apex of 
the Calamity as Darkness pressed in all around out in the reaches of the asteroid belt another 
miraculous occurrence would take place aboard one of the Exodus program vessels known as Exodus 
green the fates of another people were being changed it would begin with a clash of light and 
darkness with a singularity and a young woman who would be the first to cross over though she would 
not know her Destiny at the time she would one day be Sovereign her mother in that moment would be 
Starlight and her father would be the dark [Music] my in the midst of the collapse an exodus 
program vessel The Exodus green was partway through its journey into the Stars the passengers 
and crew Were Meant to form a new Outpost of humanity somewhere out in the universe their plans 
were first interrupted by a silent shadow that was stalking their ship through the cold reaches 
of space the ship's Captain Alice Lee hailed the pursuing vessel multiple times to no avail a 
phantom pursuer alone would be Troublesome enough but this vessel was likely one of the black Fleet 
pyramid ships thus spelling an almost certain Doom when it caught up with them their plans 
were further altered by the beginning of the collapse the warmind Rasputin dispatched orders 
to The Exodus green to begin using its defensive kinetic weapons as artillery and to return to 
the system to counter the arriving threat Alice Lee pursued by a mysterious as salant and being 
recalled to fight for a system that she would soon not even call home ignored the war mine's 
orders and sought to save her crew her Defiance would not win her any Mercy with her pursuers 
which quickly entered weapons range and began to violently grip the vessel with gravity waves 
Alice Lee and the rest of the crew were being stretched on a molecular level torn aund slowly 
as they tried to flee desperately in this moment Alice Lee sent out every combo an antenna that she 
could possibly extend she sent out a request into the dark for anything to hear that might care she 
declared her intention that her and her crew were to be considered a separate entity from humanity 
and soul a neutral party with no allegiance to Earth whether or not this made any difference to 
their Fates is unknown but there was at least one crew member who was determined to take fate into 
her own hands hands her name was Mara and she had seen that soon she was likely to die she wished to 
go out on her own terms so she dawned a space suit and went out on a long tether from the main vessel 
her brother oldwin as was his nature followed in her footsteps as Alice Lee sent out her message 
with the exus green surrounded by Darkness a sudden light appeared in that moment a clash of 
primordial forces took place and the Very fabric of the universe buckled a singularity formed 
within that Clash of light and dark and it began to drag The Exodus green into its depths seeing 
his sister in Mortal Peril oldwin reached out and beckoned Mara to return to the Exodus green but 
Mara did not look back and as the ship and aldwin and Mara were pulled towards the singularity the 
young woman who would one day be one of Soul's mightiest sovereigns cut the cord connecting her 
to the vessel and reached towards Infinity she would choose her own fate she would be the first 
within the singularity everything would change the people of The Exodus green would awaken on 
the other side of the singularity and they would be forever changed by the synthesis of light and 
dark that they had encountered Alice Lee was the first to wake and she discovered Mara next and as 
the future Queen rose from a cold dream the two of them beheld what Alice Lee believed to be a world 
of her own creation deep within the singularity the world had had been created its rivers flowed 
like silver and its endless forests teamed with life uncounted they called this world the 
distributary and as it was located on the other side of the black hole it was separated from the 
ravages of Saul inside the singularity time also passed far more rapidly than it did outside and 
so what might be but a second for us might have been a hundred years for those that lived in the 
distributary slowly Alice Lee and maras sov began to wake up the others until most of the 40,000 or 
so crew and passengers of The Exodus green were also roused from their Slumber their numbers were 
harshly imbalanced with the majority of the crew being women as a result the society that developed 
within the distributary was a matriarchal one and the men of the new civilization that was born were 
not often assigned to any positions within their hierarchy that might be considered hazardous in 
any manner with their lifespans being practically infinite within the depths of the singularity 
these people were functionally Immortal and so each of them would grow to become a Fountain 
of Knowledge and experience mastering their many crafts over the thousands of years with 
their skin turned Hues of blue gray and purple these new people strowed out across the 
distributary and declared themselves to be children of a covenant between the light and 
dark they would call themselves The awoken the awoken were immediately split between those of the 
891 original remaining crew of The Exodus green and the 40,000 or so passengers that had simply 
been colonists in stasis aboard the 800 91 were considered to be leaders and the 40,000 were in 
many ways subordinate but regardless there were questions that all the newly reborn awoken would 
be asking about their foundational experience the existence that they now found themselves 
in answering these questions could determine the balance of power amongst this new people for 
time in memorium and so a council was convened to address all concerns Chief amongst them was 
whether the awoken should return to where they had come from and leave the distributary or remain 
within its bounds to prosper eternally those that wished to leave were known as the eolys who 
believed that the awoken owed a debt to the cosmos that had saved them from destruction those 
that wished to stay were known as the sanguin who believed that the Covenant of light and dark 
that had created the awoken had been made with the understanding understanding that they would 
forfeit all right to their history in exchange for a new start here within the distributary Alice 
Lee proudly proclaimed the sanguin position and declared that the awoken should go forth and 
explore the infant Cosmos of the distributary in secret marasol would counsel others gathered by 
her reborn brother alren and would state that when the time was right they would all return Alice 
Lee would leave this first Council in an ascendant position and proclaimed herself to be the first 
queen of the awoken as she believed herself to be the first of the awoken to have ever existed 
after the many decrees about the awoken people that day were spoken aloud into Covenant and law 
Alice Lee made her first command as the queen of this newly reborn people there would be no lies 
amongst the awoken little did she know that this woman well-intentioned first decree would be the 
source of so much pain and would also bring about her downfall as the awoken people expanded out 
across the distributary some would form tribal groups out by the forests and seas predominantly 
these people were of the echo persuasion those who dwelled in the cities on the other hand tended 
to be of the sanguin mindset unbeknownst to all but a few the seeds for division were laid made 
in this foundational difference one day a woman from the original 891 crew of The Exodus green 
came forward with words like fire she was the dierum and she would loudly Proclaim that Alice 
Lee had committed deide the murder of a god it had long been accepted that Alice Lee had been the 
creator of the awoken peoples and the distributary the dierum stated that Alice Lee could have 
chosen for all the awoken to have a Divine form that she had instead chosen to grant them 
the same mortal form that they had maintained in their past lives the diim stated that through 
this Choice Alice Lee had effectively created all awoken suffering in the universe she had killed 
their potential Divinity in its crib the real damage of the statement was not simply the notion 
that all awoken had been denied in existence with without suffering it was also that Alice Lee had 
potentially lied by Omission she was meant to be the queen without secrets and yet she had kept the 
most terrible secret for herself this moment this accusation of the murder of unborn Gods would be 
the event that began the first war of the awoken the theodicy war prior to this moment there had 
been no need for paladins or protectors but with the the Odyssey War a Rubicon of conflict was 
crossed and the awoken would changed forever the war would erode the authority of the queen but she 
would eventually send Osan sov maras sovs mother to negotiate with the dearam and sue for peace 
when osana met with the diaram she promised her that her daughter maraso would tell her any secret 
she desired to know in exchange for peace and so it was that the diim traveled to meet marasa at 
top the mountain where she resided and was never seen again the questions of what happened and how 
the dierum Disappeared persist in the Legends here to this day did Mara kill her did she cease to 
be having heard an unimaginable secret did she change her ways and choose a new life after 
having caused the first war was it always Mara all along none can be sure but what we do 
know is that the diim was most certainly Mara's puppet in this regard she would allow the echoed 
cause to wither for a time she did not believe it was the right moment for the awoken to return 
but one day return they would before that time would arrive Mara would have a chance encounter 
that would change her life forever as the sanguin factions true truth flourished their scribes 
gathered all knowledge including portance and prophecy to their side in this way they heard the 
discontent of Mara and Aldren who still quietly supported the echo position to these Scholars they 
represented something of an existential threat if Mara were to ever gain power in the future she 
could be the spark that started a second theodicy war one day a colossal awoken Warrior would enter 
the Court of some of these scribes armed with a longbow so massive that only a woman of her 
unchallenged strength could even string it let lone draw it to its fullest length she declared 
that her name was s Ido and that she was hunting marasol for the murder of her lady the diaram the 
scholars of the sanguin saw this as a chance to potentially save thousands of lives by taking 
just one so they did what they could to direct s though she would still not find her Quarry for 
a long time under the awoken second Queen mooya pin a masked figure would enter the Royal Court 
this was Mara in Disguise and she would counsel the queen for a long time swaying her to become 
an eoy and encouraging her to open her Court to all the knowledge of the world the many scholars 
gathered there would be set to work in a way that Suited Mara's cause but one day into this court 
many years later s Ido would walk still Furious over the death of the diim still hunting Mara 
but when she found Mara in her laboratory she was stopped in her tracks her Fury was suddenly 
tempered by Mara's grace and beauty her hatred wilted and something else blossomed in its stead 
s Ido could not bear to kill Mara and so she threw down her weapon she declared that she would wound 
someone beloved to Mara thus leaving her forever maed in spirit because she could not bear to kill 
Mara in all her beauty Mara could not refuse this Challenge and so her brother Aldren became her 
chosen Champion the two Warriors would battle each other with Blade with rifle and with fifth 
generation superiority Fighters the new new of this Jewel sent the scribes that had sicked seur 
on Mara into a wild panic over the centuries since they had sicked s on Mara they had found a place 
in the new Queen's court and realized that if they were found to have sanctioned this murder they 
would be banished luckily for these Idol Scholars The Duel between Aldren and seur would have a most 
unexpected outcome when fighting with blades The Brute strength of s was equal to the the Finesse 
and footwork of alren they both fell together and thus it was a tie when fighting with rifles the 
two Warriors fought in the distributor's great jungles whilst alren was the better Hunter SE used 
her disruptive power to brute force of Victory swaying Nature's Balance against alren forcing 
the forer to expose him in this way she secured Victory and had been able to severely wound alren 
in the process for their final battle both of them were supplied with any choice of ship that they 
desired SE had chosen a powerful hermine Tac Interceptor Aldren had chosen an outdated ship 
called a dart what seure failed to realize was that per the terms of the jewel any weapons that 
could not be supplied would be simulated instead the dart's standard weapon Loadout was capable 
of being switched with an air-to-air new nuclear munition using this simulated munition alren 
scored a Kill from over 80 km away and S Ido lost before she could even see him the score was all 
tied up realizing the stalemate Su threw herself before Mara and said that with the tie her fate 
was in Mara's hands she pleaded for a more kind fate than that of the diaram who she had sworn 
to avenge Mara approached the humbled Warrior and said rise s Ido let us take the stars together the 
exact story of the blossoming love between Mara and S is not recorded in complete detail but given 
the lifespans of the awoken were near infinite it may have been a love that endured as unassailably 
as the moon and the tides that it brings marrow would have need of strong Confidant especially for 
what came next and few amongst the awoken were as strong as s Ido Mara scoured the great Archives 
of the awoken looking for knowledge she had to prove what she already knew that the awoken had 
to return to the greater Universe to do this she launched countless satellites and instruments of 
observation into the orbit of the distributor's planetary gravity when she had sufficient proof 
she would address the awoken people and tell them of this most fundamental of truths Mara 
at this point was the face of the acoy belief and with data to back up her assertion she would 
inform the awoken of the reality that they had to face returning to the Universe At Large would 
be perilous and it would pull the awoken from the distribut thus robbing them of their immortality 
but Mara's sway over the people was immense what's more Mara told them of the fragments that had 
been retrieved from the observation instruments what little they had heard indicated that their 
kin on the other side were in terrible danger and that the awoken had escaped the same fate the 
distributary was a refuge but they had arrived there by escaping a Madness more ancient than one 
might fathom despite the danger and the guarantee of embracing mortality Mara gained the support of 
tens of thousands of the awoken thus granting her the people that she would need for an exploratory 
Expedition back into Saul before she left she deemed that there was one thing she had to do Mara 
went to Alice Lee the first queen of the awoken she who had believed the distributary to be of her 
design who the dierum had accused so long ago of robbing the awoken of vinity to whom Mara had told 
the first lie sitting with her Mara would tell her the truth it was not Alice Lee who had created the 
distributary it was not Alice Lee who had been the first amongst their people it was not Alice Lee 
who had denied the awoken their Divinity it was Mara she was the first Alice Lee was in raged at 
the truth knowing now that Mara had engineered all that had happened across the history of the awoken 
knowing that all the suffering of their people was her fault knowing that Mara was guilty of the 
very thing she herself had been accused of an accusation so strong that it sparked and knew the 
concept of War itself in a universe unblemished by it Alice Lee would then throw her support 
behind Mara's Expedition from that moment not out of a agreement but so that she could rid the 
distributary of Mara forever the last thing she called Mara was the devil after some preparation 
the Expedition would be successful and Mara would return to Saul it was then that she discovered 
the system in utter chaos she quickly established habitats and outposts within the reaches of what 
had been known as the asteroid belt it was now strewn with the abandoned derel vessels that had 
fled during the collapse only to be destroyed by the black Fleet a foul Reef of dead ships Mara's 
utex the same group that would one day become the teans also discovered that various members of the 
awoken Expedition had developed new powers upon leaving the distributary these Powers manifested 
most strongly in Mara and Mara was in herself like an amplifier to those around her it did not 
take long for Mara to Proclaim herself as the new Sovereign of this people of the awoken of the reef 
there were however many who wished to immediately depart for Earth and to assist their long lost 
Brethren Mora urged caution and believed that they needed to build up a stable base of power first 
many vehemently disagreed with her there were even riots on the matter which momentarily plunged The 
Reef into chaos exploiting this opportunity a new set of Interlopers descended on the awoken through 
the many painful years of the long drift the elix had arrived in Saul more vicious and tenacious 
than they had ever been before these Fallen would momentarily clash with the awoken and Mara seur 
and Aldren had to Rally their people to fight off the Invaders as the Raiders were fought back some 
of the awoken had taken the opportunity to act on their desires and a vessel was quickly launched 
away from The Reef before anyone could stop it seeing her control start to wither Mara relented 
the awoken would be given one choice each they could either remain in the reef under her Rule 
and build towards a future for the system on their own terms or they could leave now and assist 
Humanity at the cost of never returning again thus the awoken who had already been torn 
apart by those who left the distributary and those who stayed were Riven once again 
into the reef born and earthborn awoken those who left Mara's control would go on to do an 
immeasurable amount of good for the people of Earth many would even be judged as being worthy 
of becoming Guardians upon their death the world that they had emerged into would be a terrifying 
one where before Humanity's Golden Age had stood now there was only ruins rust and the remains 
of those who had died in the collapse [Music] as the awoken were given their choice and some of 
them made their way to Earth they found a solar system in turbulent chaos the black Fleet and its 
disciples had been pushed back but there were many other threats that Rose in their absence it isn't 
known who arrived first or exactly when records from this time are scant and next to non-existent 
such was the nature of history and Technology there would be no true datek keeping or timeline 
from this moment onwards there would only be the vicious clawing cycle of Night and Day season to 
season what we do know is that of the forces that appeared in Saul the awoken were clearly not the 
first the alix's long drift had come to a close but not all of them had universally settled in 
the asteroid belt as the awoken had discovered arriving in sa many of the different houses of 
the elix would spread out across the system to claim new territory the house of devils would 
claim Earth's cosmodrome the house of rain would claim the sun soaked fields of mercury the house 
of winter would claim the Ishtar sink on Venus and the house of wolves would claim territory in the 
Jovian moons Hardy scavengers and survivors that they were the elix resilient physiology allowed 
them to survive almost anywhere so long as there were enough resources for their ctors to turn into 
ether but at this point they were more than just scavengers content to pick over the bones of our 
civilization they were drawn here by the traveler and in their Exodus from Reese many houses had 
developed into war bands ruled by desps none were as Infamous as the first known Kell of the House 
of devils aalu who had taken the action that led the Exodus Fleet of the elix on the long drift 
in the first place it was he who would plunder what had once been golden age London and Burn It 
To The Ground before taking his house Eastward to the European Plains and the rich hunting grounds 
of bonor Fallen were not the only Warlords to establish themselves in this time either having 
been drawn there by the fall of nar's pyramid Hive forces under the banner of croa would begin to 
infest the moon where they constructed a massive pit this pit would eventually be turned into a 
terrifying subterranean Fortress with dozens of different offshoots catacombs and ritual Chambers 
we would know it then as the hellmouth from here prototo would create the infrastructure necessary 
to Stage a long-scale hive invasion of Earth when the time was right from this Fortress and its 
attached facilities Hive Ceda vessels would be launched in the direction of Earth and thousands 
upon thousands of cro brood would invade the helm construction had been built in a downwards fashion 
for another reason though br's forces were intent on reaching the Pyramid of nzar but much as they 
tried to gain access they were always denied by the pyramid itself and so they collected in its 
shadow like a roaling colony of ants with dreams of Stellar conquest and dark Gods Cotto's father 
was not far behind as many of or's servants are often found in proximity of those worlds blessed 
by the Light as he had done many times before he quietly established his presences throughout 
the system seeding worlds with his forward armies Advanced Broods on Earth the jovians the 
asteroid belt and Beyond they would prepare for the day when cot's Army was ready and would bring 
forth great tribute in the king's name whilst some Intruders were subtle others were utterly blunt 
none more so than the cabal multitudes of scout Legions sent by Dominus G IED in Soul including 
the sand eaters dust Giants Siege dancers blind Legion and Sky burners together they would 
collectively lay claim to Mars and spread their forces across its surface to rapidly establish 
a series of heavily entrenched bases and battle lines their control over the moon of Phobos was 
so complete that they were able to establish an entire fleet base there Fleet based kuros a 
staging ground for the sky burners and their vessels and a defensive Hub that would coordinate 
the operations of the cabal throughout the system there were indications that even these initial 
Scout Legions were capable of some terrifying levels of Destruction destruction on a planetary 
scale with that in mind one of their most powerful assets was probably a trio of Scion flares that 
had evolved into their greater forms this Trio known as the ice Reapers was responsible for 
intelligence gathering and the retrieval of advanced technology but their psionic powers 
were also put to display in a most prominent fashion the flares began to pull Mars's Moon of 
Phobos into an unnaturally low orbit to the point where you could prominently see it in the Martian 
Sky supposedly this was to be used as a weapon of last resource that could be deorbited from Mars 
thus destroying the entire planet if the campaign was going badly such Force feels excessive but 
it is characteristically the cabal way and their powerful Munitions and and strong Logistics 
operation would allow them to contend with the Awakening of the oldest beings within Saul deep 
within the CES of many of our planets and moons Lakes of radial are and fluid began to flow with 
a renewed purpose all across the system from Venus to Mercury to Mars the Vex began to awaken the 
ishar collective had previously discovered them on Venus in the ishar sink and had determined 
that their ruins had been there for billions of years now those ruins began to Spring to life 
and Vex frames began to emerge from those ruins to accomplish the inscrutable goals of the Vex whilst 
many worlds were blighted by the Vex some such as mercury were completely overrun Mercury's core was 
consumed and completely hollowed out to create a giant Vex simulation engine known as the infinite 
Forest the once lar paradise and bread basket of the system that mercury had been was trans formed 
into a blasted Wasteland parked with the Stony spires and metallic plating of Vex installations 
and then at the heart of it all there was Humanity broken fractured surrounded and desperate the 
collapse had been a body blow to us as a species but we now faced the grueling task of surviving 
the Hostile system that had once been our Dominion whilst the whole of humanity was threatened there 
was one group who found themselves in an utterly unique situation on the edges of the system The 
Exodus Indigo had landed on Neptune having been damaged by an attack on their vessel by one of 
the Disciples of the witness or what is presumed to be a disciple on Neptune they were able to use 
their ship's supplies including a small amount of sver to establish a basic habitable colony and 
then came the remarkable discovery that savathun had left for them the Veil amongst the number 
of The Exodus Indigo were the Ishtar Collective researchers chioma essi and mundesh they would 
set about studying the veil and would eventually find a way to derive power from it even though 
it would have many adverse effects on many of the EXO members of their crew it didn't take long 
for the Vex to discover them and whilst they would be able to push into nuna's outer defenses they 
were consistently stopped by the energy emitted by the veil itself in response to this the vex 
created a simulation that was woven into Neptune's electromagnetic field this hid all in proximity 
of the veil and the veil itself thus preventing any humans within that area from being detected 
by the outside world for a long time it would also cut them off from any potential reinforcements 
but this worked out well for the fledgling Colony on Neptune they were able to hold the Vex at Bay 
and to secure their prosperity in the time being the screen hiding them from all of the defense 
of the system meant that they were in relative isolation thus with their infrastructure and 
their defenses starting to be built up the city of neomuna was born one of its earliest residents 
a woman named Michaela YULA was exposed to some of the technology that had been brought with them on 
the Exodus Indigo in particular she was exposed to a strange series of nanites from sver the nanites 
infected her body and violently changed it causing her to grow metal plating across parts of her 
body giving her remarkable strength and incredible speed as well as the ability to regenerate she 
used this accident to her advantage and became a vicious fighting force against nuna's Vex Invaders 
though she would only live for about 10 years after the accident she would be known from then on 
as The Strider and her selfless actions were the creation point for the cloud Strider organization 
as time went on the establishment of the cloud Striders was made far more entrenched they had 
a device that they would eventually use called the siderial and that would allow them to create 
new Cloud Striders but given the nature of the experimental technology being used only two Cloud 
Striders would be created at a time one of the later Cloud Striders by the call sign of Stargazer 
would head out on a mission to Earth in order to make contact with any remnants of humanity 
that they could find they had hoped to defin segments of human civilization that they could 
establish diplomatic Communications with perhaps even uplifting them to rejoin Humanity on Nuna 
what they discovered on Earth was Anarchy Earth's people had not been as fortunate as Neptune's 
and many of them had been eeking out a living from what little remained worse still were those 
that had been blessed by the Traveler's light in these early Dark Age days there was little to stop 
a lightbearer with a ghost from being considered a God every time someone killed them they could be 
brought back from the grave with their ability to defy death and with the paracausal abilities that 
they had been gifted with their light some of them quickly Rose to become Regional rulers these 
were some of the first Warlords lightbearers who used their powers to impose their will over 
others and dominate the world as they saw fit the cloud Strider known as Stargazer would encounter 
a warlord at some point and they were followed by a small army numbering in the hundreds they 
shot the warlord and retreated with their team inside a warmind bunker before destroying 
the bunker to prevent its harmful weapons from getting into the hands of their aggressors 
Stargazer petitioned one of Rasputin's surviving submesh to delete all references across the 
warmed Network to Neptune and The Exodus Indigo this would keep the presence of neomuna truly 
secure and would make us blissfully unaware of its existence for hundreds of years years when 
Stargazer returned to Nuna they were ready to inform the populace of their findings and for 
the longest time it would be the belief of all nomuni that Earth was merely a lawless Frontier 
filled with tyrants and Warlords and those trying desperately to survive for the longest time 
they would have been right to believe such a thing too for in the earliest days of the Dark 
Age War ravaged the entire system and nobody was truly safe the nuni were not the only only ones 
to note this the awoken were keenly aware that the system was treacherous it was for this reason 
that marov sent out her brother Aldren to seek a source of power for her that was unique in this 
system thus granting her an asymmetric Advantage Aldren scoured the system and returned with a 
mysterious paracausal creature a wish Dragon also known as an aramara these beasts were shape 
shifters capable of completely altering their form the aamar were also armed with a terrible power 
wish magic a paracausal ability that allowed them to read the desires of their prey and then 
grant their wishes whilst also twisting the threads of Fate to do so unfortunately in the 
twisting of such wishes fian Bargains would be created thus petitioning a wish Dragon for one's 
desire was a perilous process requiring great discipline the creature that Aldrin had discovered 
and presented to Mara called itself Riven in honor of its new hosts honoring the twice Riven 
awoken but it was not alone wish dragons populated the system on almost every planet but 
were particularly concentrated on Venus together Riven and Mara would set about creating a grand 
home for the awoken and the aamar mara declared that they would be more than survivors though 
they would be a people and thus through Mara's vision and riven's Magic the awoken would build 
a place worthy of their people the dreaming City this would not be the awoken Capital but it would 
be one of their most holy sites a place for them to learn connect with their ancestors and meditate 
on the nature of the world ahamkara would flock to the dreaming City and they would live alongside 
the awoken for a time in a mostly peaceful albeit cautious symbiosis yet another secret Enclave 
was constructed in Soul but this time on Earth there was no place for people to run to not yet 
at least in those early days Refugee Caravans trailed across the world looking for anywhere that 
they might find some degree of safety some would attempt to establish small settlements and towns 
like palamon or coyote and whilst these places would be home to for some they were not fated 
to last Fallen Raiders Rogue lightbearers and the Wilderness of the frontier would be the 
forces that eventually spell to Doom to these settlements Hope was scarce indeed but slowly From 
the Ashes of Ruin and death a spark of hope would be kindled one day a group of five Warlords set a 
village to the torch another group of lightbearers made their presence known that day and at Great 
cost they defeated the wouldbe tyrants and vowed that there would be no more death there would 
be no more without protectors Humanity needed its protectors and so it was that these first four 
lightbearers present on this day would become some of Humanity's first great Guardians radagast perun 
yolder and Saladin would be counted among the very first of the iron Lords in time they would bring 
more legendary figures into the fall old silar gelon scory Timur ephrodite and felwinter and 
when Fel winter was folded into the iron Lords he agreed that they would be able to use his Peak 
though he kept the name of fell winter Peak from it the iron Temple was born and Earth had its 
first small Enclave of relative safety for some but it would not be the last and luckily it would 
be maintained even though silar had to rebuild it multiple times the names of the iron Lords 
would be honored within the iron Temple under an Ironwood tree and those names would stand in 
legendary regard amongst Guardians even to this day this was the first nightly order that would 
bring some semblance of control and peace to the world they would challenge the Warlords and drive 
them back under the tutelage of the original iron Lords many great Heroes would be molded into 
the finest Protectors of humanity one way or another not least amongst their number would be an 
awoken man of great strength called Zavala and a strange human of impatient disposition and great 
knowledge called Osiris the heroes of Earth had begun to make their Mark but the people of Earth 
still needed a true place to call home and the iron Temple was not large enough for the whole 
of humanity for so many there was but one place they could go when one place more obvious than 
any other they went to that strange place where the traveler had made its final stand in the 
shadow of this broken God Humanity's remnants would begin to regroup the refugee camp grew 
and grew and eventually their numbers swelled to the point where everyone needed to be properly 
organized and in this moment we nearly destroyed ourselves once again from the huddled masses 
there were inevitably different perspectives Ives on what had to be done we should make ready 
to leave Earth for good we should stake our claim and choose strong leaders to guide us we should 
prepare for war each of these different ideas in turn attracted more and more people eventually 
they attracted lightbearers and before the camp had even truly been able to establish itself 
there were factions within its boundaries and as these factions began to clash lightbearer would 
eventually fight lightbearer it was in this time that the division within this fledgling refugee 
camp gave a perfect opportunity for the Fallen to arrive and plunder the great host of human 
survivors they did not know the true power of the Guardians on that day though and in the face 
of an external threat the factions were able to put aside their differences and repel the Invaders 
these skirmishes were known as the faction Wars and they nearly destroyed the only home Humanity 
had on earth a leader would need to step forward someone would need to organize them but it would 
not take long for the elix to return this time though they would return in strength the faction 
Wars may have been the first time that this new fledgling City had seen battle but it would not 
be the last as more and more Guardians returned and as more and more walls were being erected 
to defend what was this small Refugee encampment eventually the house of devils saw a moment to 
strike this would be the first great conflict between the elix and Humanity on such a scale and 
for the Fallen it was dramatically important they had seen that the traveler had settled on Earth 
they had seen that it had died for this other people they had even seen that it had sheltered 
them beneath its great bulk and worst of all it had granted its gift its blessing to the various 
members of that Civilization even Beyond its own death for the Fallen this was not just a religious 
War this was their moment to prove that they were still worthy of the great machine and so the house 
of devils descended upon the city in numbers the defense of the city under this barrage of Fallen 
artillery was mostly conducted by Guardians though some rudimentary frames and some members of 
the civilian population would be armed in this terrifying fight this first battle there would 
be six different fronts and the many Guardians that would hold those different fronts would not 
let even a single one break thus the battle was known as the battle of the six fronts and From 
This Moment the city would truly emerge it was Humanity's first true Victory and many legendary 
Guardians such as Commander Zavala St 14 Lord Shack and Osiris would emerge as Legends on that 
day having defended the city with their vicious light it was also in this moment that many other 
Legends were born a speaker had come forward one who could supposedly hear the Traveler's voice and 
what's more he had begun to organize the last City properly there were factions within our ranks 
and there were various lightbearers that needed organizing it was clear now that the lightbearers 
were split across three disciplines Hunters Titans and warlocks the speaker created a Vanguard a 
group of three individuals one representing each discipline Titans were heavily CLA in the greatest 
of armor and favored more brutish aspects of Martial combat their will to charge the enemy was 
only tempered by their instinct to defend those in need Hunters were nomadic and free-spirited they 
often roamed alone or in small posies acting as Scouts on the wild frontiers of Earth or Beyond 
or bold adventurers willing to disregard Authority and their own safety for a little glimmer and 
Glory warlocks quickly became known for their wisdom and sheer Arcane power of all the different 
classifications of lightbearer their connection to the traveler was the fiercest and through that 
connection they would unearth Grand Arana and Forge new techniques of light these lightbearers 
that had defended this encampment would no longer be known as lightbearers though thanks to their 
defense of this fledgling City the lightbearers had earned themselves a title it would Define 
them for the rest of their existence they would be known as Guardians and the first amongst the 
Vanguard were drawn from their number thus sa 14 Osiris and Tula Fairwind ascended to be the 
first ever mentors of the Vanguard for the Titans warlocks and Hunters respectively and as 
for the factions they were also looped in whilst they had nearly destroyed the last City during the 
faction Wars they still represented many important perspectives and so with them in mind the speaker 
would take a look to see which ones were worth representing those that had directly instigated 
violence were exiled permanently but those that had not and those that had peacefully laid down 
their arms would be allowed to continue persisting of the many that petitioned to be represent 
presented more directly there were three that were most popular the concordat the new monarchy 
and the dead orbit their perspectives would be represented on a consensus Council they would be 
at the heart of government within the consensus at large that was also joined by the Vanguard 
members and the speaker there was also a greater consensus Council that also consisted of any other 
citizens and other factions within the city those such as the future War cult or the Symmetry were 
represented here in addition this was by far the greatest echo of the battle of the six fronts the 
union of Humanity's light-bearing Defenders and those who would represent the civilian population 
into a government was a significant step forward for Humanity but it wouldn't be the only Echo 
the six fronts for which the battle was given its name were held predominantly by four Titan 
orders as best we know they were the pilgrim the fire break order the stoneborn order and the 
first pillars regardless of which of these orders were present on that day we do know that the 
defense of this fledgling City on six fronts by four orders of Titans is the reason for Titan 
heraldry being what it is a hexagon of six sides with four different divided pieces to it their 
heraldry has always remembered six fronts it is one of their proudest achievements to defend 
the last City without a single one of these fronts breaking and as it began to grow this 
fledgling City that had once been nothing but a refugee camp simply became known as the last 
City the last safe haven for Humanity in Saul as best we knew at the time whilst there were some 
amongst the Titan orders who lamented the way that six fronts ended in particular the fire break who 
wished that they could have their glorious charge into the ranks of the retreating Fallen there were 
many other dangers throughout the system and soon the Guardians would be rallied to deal with them 
in particular securing the city's defenses would allow us to turn our eyes to the rest of the 
system there were terrible things happening on Venus in particular the aamar was starting 
to transform it we didn't understand why at the time but it is likely that this is thanks to the 
intervention of the nine and from what we had seen we had realized the power of these terrible 
beasts was a threat that we could not allow to exist and so the order was given the Guardians 
would hunt down the ahamkara and bring about their Extinction it was not an easy choice to make 
Guardians had gained power from their Bargains but much had also been lost and aramara Bargains 
were notoriously fian the ahamkara would be hunted down and made extinct the terrible weight of this 
decision would be a stain upon Guardian history for all our days thankfully though we weren't 
truly efficient for all the Guardians that did hunt down dragons there would be many that didn't 
return and there were rumors that some escaped the hunt though the cryptar mostly dismissed this 
as nothing but Superstition but the Guardians never found Riven marasol had hid her away in the 
dreaming City and at long last she had found her unique source of power but this was not the only 
tragedy that would befall the lightbearers in the dark age as what one might considered to be 
the Dark Age Drew to a close the iron Lords were making significant progress in cutting down 
their warlord aggressors Earth was starting to fall under one Banner where human territory 
was concerned and the iron Lords were doing a decent job at uniting humanity and then they 
discovered something the iron Lord warlock known as felwinter was searching relentlessly for sver 
alongside Lord Timur the nanotechnology that was meant to all but guarantee the self-sufficiency 
of humanity would be a grand prize in fact for many of the iron Lords it would be an obsession 
eventually felwinter discovered where to find it and he also discovered something about himself he 
learned that he was a sedata Golem an EXO risen to be Rasputin's eyes and ears within Humanity 
effectively a spy but more accurately someone who would be able to keep tabs on human civilization 
and for Rasputin to learn from but when fell winter was destroyed and then risen again as a 
lightbearer what little of Rasputin that remained on Earth was incensed and enraged continuously 
felwinter would be the target of orbital strikes and strange attacks from any warmed installation 
that he went near to felwinter was in many cases like a sun to Rasputin and what little of him 
had recognized fell winter in that moment was jealous of the traveler for having stolen his 
son or what he would think of as his son and like so many jealous fathers Rasputin would seek 
to punish his offspring eventually with much work and dedication fell winter would discover that 
there was a production site for sea nanites in the Eastern section of the cosmodrome this was 
what the iron Lords had been looking for it represented a way to lift the people of humanity 
out of squala and to return us to the Golden Age The Iron Lords descended upon the cosmod droman 
force at the order of their leader but first amongst equals Lord radagast more than a 100 iron 
Lords descended upon the cosmodrome but what they found that day was not sver as a tool but sea as a 
plague sea had been given orders upon noticing the intrusion and presence of felwinter these orders 
came from the remnant of Rasputin that controlled it it was a series of orders contained in only 
three words three words that Rasputin would live to learn and regret till the end of his life 
replicate eliminate immunize the nanites were Unleashed as weapons and there was nothing that 
the iron Lords could do over a 100 iron Lords descended into that place which would one day be 
called the plague lands of those hundred or so that entered there would be only two survivors 
that day Lord Saladin Forge and Lady ephrodite cver production was momentarily stopped the iron 
Lord yolder had taken an explosive device deep into the sver replication complex and she had 
managed to detonate it just as everyone was being consumed by the nanites but even in their 
failure the legend of the iron Lords lived on partly as a cautionary tale and partially as a 
heroic one and they were not alone the last City might have been built on the greatest tragedy 
of humankind that from its humble beginnings Legends would rise and with them there would be a 
chance for Humanity to prosper once again [Music] something that regularly proves to be a 
frustration when talking about Destiny's law and its timelines is that in the relatively early 
dates before the actual foundation of the city after the collapse and from then on onwards there 
are very few actual references to actual dates the people of Earth had little time to record keep and 
as they fled for their lives the days bled into each other the months split into each other thus 
it is often hard to determine where one age begins and another has ended there is no greater example 
of this than with the transition from the Dark Age to the city age some say it began with the 
completion of the first of the Ci's walls others say it began at the conclusion of the battle of 
the six fronts others still believe that it began with the formation of the consensus no matter the 
truth the result is the same the Guardians had a to find their City alive and with hope for the 
future and in their Noble defense of the last City the Guardians would push out into the 
Wilds to deal with strange and deadly forces that had plagued our worlds a new order was a 
real possibility that at last lay Within Reach or so they thought back in the days of the city 
age these moments might have been separated by days they might have been separated by centuries 
but regardless we know from the legends that stand before us even to this day that they did happen 
there are small hints as to the chronology of things but still there are moments where things 
might be inaccurate so with that in mind the events are chronicled in this order as I believe 
they are indeed the correct order there must have been first a time of Peace where Guardians 
were allowed to reflect on their greatness and when the city was assured of the supremacy of its 
Defenders it is perhaps the only thing that makes sense because of the hubris of what happened 
next the city was Keen to expand its territory further it started with small expeditions to the 
outer worlds of the system and to the inner core in particular of note St 14 had been tasked 
with leading one such group of survivors to try and recolonize Mercury before realizing that 
it was overrun by the house of rain whilst these initial failures had slowed them down the city was 
still looking to reclaim Humanity's lost wonders and they set their sights in the same place that 
preg Golden Age humans had long ago they looked to the Moon our one true Celestial neighbor within 
Striking Distance the initial reports suggested that Luna was Hive territory with something of a 
ragtag fallen presence there too the consensus was committed to securing a foothold on the moon and 
retaking it for humanity and even as they suddenly realized that it was also home to The Hive they 
did not believe they could be stopped but in the meeting where the forces were being committed to 
war and where the consensus was ready to vote on an invasion of the Moon they were interrupted by a 
guardian called lord sha a former warlord of great Renown and power sha was one of the most tested 
Battlefield commanders in the city and he knew in his gut that the assault on the moon was a Terri 
able idea he had seen what the hive could do he remembered a key victory that the city had fought 
against them a conflict that they had barely won it was known as the battle of the burning Lake and 
there Shacks had witnessed firsthand the power of the hiv's blades and understood that in them there 
was a potential answer to the light of Guardians they were not like any other force in Saul they 
could summon the true powers of Darkness to their side but despite his please Lord Shacks was 
ignored and the Guardians of the last City began to assemble into the greatest army of Guardians 
that had ever been seen a host of thousands would assemble under the banner of the corant seal 
led by the praic order and they would march on Luna with the intent of reclaiming Humanity's 
Stellar Birthright unique weapons of war such as the thunderlord and its sisters abidon and the 
no mortis were created in preparation for the assault it was meant to be the great liberation 
of Luna but it would be known instead as the great disaster upon their arrival the forces 
of Guardians would spread out to capture their objectives and would encounter Fierce resistance 
from the bands of Fallen that they came across but when they hit the depths of Luna then things would 
change the hidden fade tactics of the Fallen would be Troublesome but they were merely a band of 
Exiles trying to scrape out a living on the moon's harsh surface the real threat below were Luna's 
true rulers when the armies of the hive emerged to engage the Guardians the battle that would 
commence was Titanic in scale the Guardians would see the strength of this terrible power firsthand 
and would be forced to face their champion at the height of his power CER had arrived and his brood 
washed over the army of the Coran seal like a tide with his sword the darkest Edge in Hand croa p 
personally slew some of the last City's greatest Champions including way ning one of the greatest 
Titans that ever lived their light was drained by his blade and their ghosts would be crushed 
into screaming knives that he used to murder them at Mara ibam where the greatest part of the 
battle took place Cota fought with a thousand Knights at his back the skies themselves turned 
green with soulfire and when cota's sword fell it cracked the surface of the Moon creating 
deep green fissures that remain to this day the Guardians were pushed back and then routed 
entirely a general retreat was sounded the battle was lost following this moment the consensus tail 
between its legs and realizing its mistake too late declared that there would be an interdiction 
Zone on the moon and within all CIS Luna space no operations on the moon were to be sanctioned 
by the Vanguard and Guardians venturing there would receive no further logistical or Operational 
Support the moon was lost and Humanity's dream of reclaiming their Golden Age Heritage was promptly 
shattered despite this Vengeance was a desire that burned in the chests of many Guardians none 
more so than Ariana 3 who had seen her lover way ning die at cot's hands a vision given 
to her by a wizard that she had interrogated on the moon showed her this exact moment alongside 
her friend Aris mour a renowned Hunter she sought the knowledge of her enemy which she would use 
to destroy them she would find herself then in the company of the one person who truly had that 
knowledge an exiled master of hi Arana the Warlock Tolland the shattered toand would join them and 
advised them on their return trip to the moon but he did not disc loose his true intentions till it 
was far too late he was obsessed with the hiv's sword logic and believed it to be the proof of 
their Supremacy throughout the Universe and so it was that this three was joined by the other 
half of their fire team the six that would go on to assault croa the first croa fire team Ariana 
3 erism toand the shattered Omar AGA saota and Vel tarow they would return to the Moon Moon and 
assault the hellmouth to avenge those Fallen at Mara ibum six of them went down into the pit only 
one would crawl out velalo and saota would fall at the hands of the hive be they the dark blades 
thall or the clawing screams of omigle Omar agar would be captured and broken torn upon the rack 
by cota's heart a wizard whose intent was torture and who stripped the light from his very being 
in strands to be fed to cota's Rising brood only Ariana and Tolland would make it to the deepest 
part of the hellmouth to The Stills where No Light reaches they crossed into cotus Throne world 
where toand heard UT the death singer and died in body though not in spirit it isn't clear whether 
Arana would face croa or not but there are hints that this moment might have indeed indeed occurred 
rumor has it that in her final moments she seemed as wholly luminescent as the sun itself alas 
cota's Darkness was greater only Aris mour would survive thanks to the sacrifice of her ghost Brier 
in the deepest parts of the hives lunar Fortress lost in its catacombs with the darkness closing in 
all around her she clutched at something that she had kept close all this time a relic of the great 
hunt against the aamar A Shard of dragon bone even the remains of the wish dragons are potent enough 
to Grant the desires of those that wield them and In This Moment iris's desire was great she had 
lost her sight lost her light and lost her ghost she wished for deliverance and perhaps for revenge 
and then Black Tears of terrible Darkness began to drip from her eyes she had already been robbed 
of her sight but now at least it seemed as though she knew the way she would steal the eyes of an 
acolyte and for a hundred years she persisted in the hellmouth until the fateful day when one day 
she might find a chance to crawl out and be the arm of Vengeance returned at last that would not 
be for some time the city had suffered greatly at the hands of its foes there was trouble Brewing 
within its own walls as well back at the Battle of the six fronts Osiris's appointment to the 
consensus was one of the earlier causes for a great degree of turmoil the concordat initially 
had frustrations with the great warlock Osiris was often too consumed with his own work to 
attend Vanguard meetings and the concordat had more strange specific complaints whether they were 
true or slander isn't known to this day Osiris was consumed by his study of the Vex and he believed 
that they were the greatest existential threat to humanity in the last City the speaker saw 
them as little more than a distraction keeping Osiris from his duties and worse still the two of 
them vehemently disagreed on many issues Osiris often challenged the speaker's Authority something 
the speaker could not easily abide the consensus and the last City have always been a political 
place as well as a place of refuge and in such a setting a man like Osiris would gain a reputation 
beyond the reality of who he was his controversial words and beliefs would be described by some as 
heretical but others would see them as prophetic ultimately this created a division of sorts 
within the city and some would disregard his words entirely whilst others believed that he 
spoke Hidden Truths in defiance of the speaker a cult of personality was starting to form with 
some openly proclaiming themselves to be Osiris's followers much to Osiris's frustration he knew he 
was no prophet he saw himself as one simply trying to convey knowledge of the coming future the 
people were twisting his words through Reckless abandon and the desire to create sensationalism 
out of fact and so he resolved to cut through the perspectives with knowledge he resolved to write 
his findings down and Cate them in the book Mar against the warnings of his pupil aor Ray another 
powerful Warlock Osiris believed that he would add objectivity to the situation by doing this but in 
reality the release of these findings that he had made only became far worse ayrian cultists began 
to distribute his findings on mass calling them Parables and prophecies the speaker saw this and 
believed that it was a brewing Insurrection or at least a disagreement amongst the people of the 
last city that might boil over he spoke to Saint 14 and despite Saints urgings he demanded that all 
copies of Osiris's writings should be burned but this was only the beginning Osiris still believed 
that the speaker wasn't listening to his warnings he was correct but his irritation with Osiris 
had gone even further at this point and it had prevented him from listening to even iora who 
was standing in for Osiris at consensus meetings this inaction as Osiris saw it had even gone so 
far as to weaken the city Osiris claimed that in particular the defenses of the last city were 
weak around an area known as Twilight Gap a preent prediction though none would know it until much 
later the speaker reached his Breaking Point as the divisions between those that followed Osiris 
and those that rejected him were growing to a boiling point in a full session of the consensus 
the speaker moved to Exile the Warlock Osiris the motion was presented in all its Grandeur with a 
great speech by the speaker and just as Osiris was about to be exiled he arrived and declared that 
he would leave the last City regardless imposing himself in a time of Exile aor Ray from that day 
onward would hold his position as the Warlock Vanguard followed by his ghost sagira Osiris would 
head to Mercury to understand the Vex better and to prepare to face them should the need arise 
eyes a gaggle of cultist followers would leave the city too heading out into the Wilds to make their 
homes beyond the speakers influence some of them even followed Osiris to Mercury and set up a camp 
within the caloris spires losing a few cultists as one thing but Osiris's Exile left tangible 
scars on the fabric of the city Beyond even just a few people leaving it was the first time 
that an internal Force had split the city since the time of the faction Wars it was the first 
time it had truly been a single man it was the first time it had been a guardian that caused 
it whilst this hadn't spilled over into real conflict it had split some of the Guardians from 
the speaker's Authority Osiris's influence had started to inspire Guardians to act independently 
of the authority of the Vanguard this weakened the city as some of the legends that we had known 
for so long as great Defenders instead headed out into the Wilds and never returned most notable 
of those would be those who followed on from Osiris's words that the Vex were indeed the most 
dangerous threat to the last City in humanity of them the most infamous were the hunter pahanin 
the Warlock prith and the Titan known as Kabir the legionless these three would head to Venus 
to the most infamous Fortress of the Vex that had been around in Soul for billions of years 
they mted to infiltrate and destroy the Vault of Glass so it was that they entered but only one 
came out the hunter bahanan witnessed the power of the Vex and was forced to flee against it being 
haunted by it for the rest of his days the Warlock prith of the future War cult was lost within the 
deepest reaches of the Vault and was imprisoned there seemingly for all eternity the Titan Kabir 
was beaten back by the Templar and then drank of Vex radial Ara barrier thus enabling himself to 
be consumed by the Vex completely and to become one with them before he died he did at least 
manage to drain what light of his remained into a shield a paracausal force known as the egis that 
would break the unbreakable and let the light into the Vault thus some of Humanity's greatest heroes 
would fall long ago such individual Legends being lost might have been born by the last City but 
now they were recurring just as Humanity was about to face its greatest test yet out in the system 
Scouts amongst the hunters had noticed significant Fallen troop movement for some time this was no 
coincidence long had the houses waited and watched The Traveler With Envy they had always plotted 
the downfall of the city but doing so was no small feat after the failure of the House of devils at 
the Battle of the six fronts it was clear that the last City could not be taken easily not a single 
Fallen house would be able to assail the Guardians in their own home but what about a United Force if 
there was not one house but many houses attacking then there was a far greater chance of Victory 
and so it was that the four greatest houses of the elix coordinated together the ks of the houses 
of devils Kings winter and wolves would Marshall their forces and send them to Earth together they 
would unite in the greatest host of elix that the Galaxy had ever seen ready to defeat the Guardians 
break their walls and reclaim the great machine at last the exact number of Fallen assembled in 
this battle is not made clear but based on what little we know about the troop strength of the 
force being brought by the house of wolves it is easy to speculate that there must have been over 
a million fallen in this Army such a tidal wave of a force would have eradicated ated the last 
City for good were it not for the actions of two staunch Heroes who stood strong in their roles 
one as a sovereign and the other as a guardian the houses began to make their moves the house of 
devils Kings and winter would be able to mobilize their forces more quickly and assembled on Earth 
with some haste but the house of wolves was not in the inner system they were in the Jovian moons and 
they would need to pass through the asteroid belt with their many catches in order to reach Earth 
it was in this moment that their Kell made a fatal error he stopped their catches at the largest 
asteroid in the asteroid belt known as series what he didn't know was that this was firmly in the 
middle of the territory of the awoken of the reef marov the awoken Queen was presented with a choice 
in this moment she could allow the Wolves to pass through thus allowing them to trample on awoken 
sovereignty and let the last City Bur burn or she could intervene at this Interruption and Invasion 
and she could put awoken lives at risk in doing so Mara had to choose to hide or to go to war and 
Mara would choose War her devastating first strike on the house of wolves made use of a tremendously 
powerful gravitational weapon an ancient set of beings known as the harbingers the harbingers were 
so powerful that they destroyed the asteroid of series and left 500,000 Dead from the house of 
wolves in this first opening engagement it is known as the scatter and it did exactly that the 
wolf Kell was amongst that number of dead and in this sudden action Mara had allowed herself to be 
embroiled in a conflict of her own a conflict with the house of wolves that would be known as The 
Reef Wars eventually the house of wolves would regroup under a powerful leader known as skolas 
the rabbit but they were unable to continue on with to Earth until they had dealt with the awoken 
threat with that in mind the awoken had bought all the time that the city would need but as we'll 
soon learn even that almost wasn't enough marasol would continuously fight the house of wolves to a 
standstill up until the point at which one broke ranks With The Wolves a scribe known as varx the 
loyal of house judgment he saw that marov was a leader that might at least be able to to ignite 
the elix fires for loyalty and unite them under one Banner he gave her critical information that 
led to the defeat and capture of skolas skolas would have called VAR a traitor no doubt but given 
that he'd already removed two of var's arms I feel as though varx might not necessarily have cared 
the remaining wolves either bent the knee to Mara or were imprisoned alongside their Kell in var's 
new jail a facility that would one day come to be known as the prison of Elders with her Victory 
here marov had denied one of the Fallen houses from an ability to attack Earth and potentially 
reclaim the great machine but she had also denied the greatest possible reinforcements in the system 
for the houses of Kings winter and Devils now there were only three houses instead of four but 
regardless this was still the largest elix army that had ever been marshaled quickly the last 
City's defense had to be organized Lord Saladin Forge was in command with his protes Commander 
Zavala and Lord Shacks at his side as the last of the iron Lords aside from lady ephrodite who 
had fled long ago Saladin was well prepared for a Siege and he had great degrees of experience but 
so did Lord shacks and Shacks also had an uncanny ability to see when a battle could be turned 
something which would happen in the greatest and most heated moment of of the battle that would 
ensue in the end the actions of a single fire team Shack's fire team would determine Victory or 
defeat that day and that fire team was present at the weakened part of the city's defenses that 
Osiris had pointed out to the speaker himself at Twilight Gap here Lord Shack was forced to 
hold the line which he quickly saw was starting to buckle and break Saladin also noted this and 
believed that this this would be where the tide broke through if they broke through it would 
be the end of humanity the forces of the elix would overwhelm the city and none would survive 
Lord Saladin made the awful choice of sounding a general Retreat to the city's ridgeback District 
believing that that might be the only place they could hold back the Fallen but Lord sha knew that 
with such a move Doom would be guaranteed for the last City and so he disobeyed Lord Saladin 
alongside his fire team Shacks held the line dying over and over back to back until eventually 
reinforcements could arrive Legends were born that day not least amongst them Anna Bray the same Anna 
Bray who had designed Rasputin in the Golden Age she had been risen By the Light of the traveler 
and had seen her name tag and badge on her person from the moment she was risen she would remember 
her name and so would many others thanks to her actions in the battle that day wherever her golden 
gun shot a whisper of the Traveler's light would be left these remnants of her light would still 
be present to this day it was also in this battle that she faked her own death so that she might 
Explore More of the legacies of her own family's past without the interference of the last City 
the battle was fear but eventually the Guardians with their rallied forces would push the elix back 
and the Counterattack was decisive enough to help break the Fallen charge for good Lord Shack and 
his fire team had saved the last City the losses from the battle were staggering a whole generation 
of Guardians was devastated in more ways than Can Be Imagined the battle of the Twilight Gap would 
change the last City forever it marked a point of remembrance and a turning point in our story The 
Guardians had held their own in an age of great uncertainty but now the true danger of their 
foes was also made more clear than ever some chose to look on Twilight Gap with Rememberance 
fasil krux and Victor lar two of the city's great industrialists and the creators of the krux lar 
Foundry would use this opportunity to design a new weapon of war in commemoration of the battle 
the yellow horn forged from the armor and light of Guardians that had fallen that day it was said 
to ring out with the power of the Fallen giving voice to their Strife once more with the howl of 
wolves others looked upon Twilight gaps events and saw the city's place as being ascendant never 
again would the elix assemble a force of this size and never again would they invade the city 
with the lofty dream of reclaiming The Traveler they would be a broken people completely from this 
point onward others saw that the battle had left the city weak and endeavored to protect it against 
even those recovering foes that were on their way none would make a greater Mark in this regard than 
sa 14 with the blessing of the speaker and with a certain Fury in his heart St 14 viciously hunted 
the elix across the system becoming a legendary monster in their eyes he hunted down the leader 
and Kells who had fought at Twilight Gap killing as many as he could get his hands on these would 
be known as the Crusades of St 14 and they would come to a close when he went to battle the Kell 
of the House of devils at the time the Devils were led by suus whose might was so great that 
he managed to grab the Titan and hoisted him clean from his feet choking the life from him 
in a famously Titan move St 14 summoned all the power he could ready for one last strike in Malay 
there was just enough space to land the blow but it wasn't a punch winding back his neck Saint 14 
headbutted sulkus the Kell of the House of devils so hard that this single strike was enough to cave 
in the Kell's skull killing him instantly S4's helmet still has a dent from this fabled incident 
that can be seen even to this day he was ready to return to the last City but then the speaker 
contacted him with new information Osiris had been seen on Mercury the Titan changed course and went 
to search for his friend his lover he would find his way to the infinite Forest the Vex simulation 
engine that Osiris had begun to enter and study into the deepest recesses of the infinite Forest 
St 14 would disappear his seat on the Vanguard would be left empty for a time for he did not 
return soon it was filled by Commander Zavala and it was assumed that St 14 had been lost Legends 
had begun to disappear at this point the city was still weakening a rot was setting in and it 
was in this moment that smelling the blood of the city the concordat would rise and make things so 
much worse the exact reason behind their Rebellion isn't well known much of their history has been 
scrubbed from the last City's records what we do know is that they Rose to overthrow the speaker 
and the consensus their betrayal would lead to the Ascension of a faction that replaced 
them the future War cult their Revolution was shortlived and they were finally defeated in 
one of the last City's towers by the Guardians and forces of new monarchy the concordat and its 
leader L sander would Retreat into the White where they have remained ever since even to this 
day when the witness's forces crowd all around us we still know Lysander is out there somewhere with 
so much Calamity and so much conflict Lord Shack felt it necessary to act he put a proposal to the 
consensus Guardians had always sparred against each other as Immortal beings with Incredible 
might they were able to resurrect after their deaths dying was not necessarily a problem for for 
a guardian unless their ghost was also killed and so there became a culture Guardians would fight 
against each other and learn from their mistakes combats were sometimes collectively referred to 
as The Crucible and these moments of fighting and infighting were often used to settle disagreements 
in a martial manner some Guardians such as aor Reay were notorious combatants in this regard 
it was Lord Shack who proposed a formalization of The Crucible under his watchful Li he would 
organize matches to pit Guardian against Guardian thus allowing their existing ranks to train in an 
environment where their deaths were not punished permanently the consensus would agree to allowing 
The Crucible to be conducted and Crucible matches would become a part of the last City's culture 
with guardians of all Stripes gaining Fame and Fortune for their performance in the Arenas of 
Lord Shacks the citizens of the last City would watch the televised conflicts or would show up 
if some of those Arenas were able to be viewed in person factions and weapon foundaries 
would sponsor Guardians who were willing to Bear their colors or insignias into battle 
betting on Crucible matches became a relatively common Pastime and fans would develop loyalties or 
attachments to individuals or teams that performed well within Sha's Crucible with The Crucible being 
truly formalized now what had merely been sparring sessions could be turned into a true training 
Avenue a new generation of Guardians were being put to the test and were being readied for war 
there was still some time before these Guardians would be ready and the Old Guard would suffer 
some terrible Fates before their Replacements could come in to take the Reigns the most notable 
of these was Andel brasque he had volunteered to become the hunter Vanguard after losing a bet with 
his close friend Cade 6 Cade had killed a terrible Fallen mercenary called tan the scard and had bet 
with his friend Andel that he'd do it first andle lost that bet and that's why he had the desk 
job the hunter Vanguard position the one job no Hunter truly wants the only problem was that 
tanx was more machine than monster and wasn't so easily killed he would swiftly return to the 
fold time and time again until he got lucky one day and ended the life of Andel brasque and his 
ghost Cade realized his error and realized that it was his overconfidence that had effectively 
gotten his friend killed in a moment of reverent selfs sacrifice and a dedication of Duty Cade took 
up andle's cloak to know the significance of this moment you need to understand the significant part 
of Hunter culture that their cloaks represent they are full of meaning and stories they are 
a representation of you as a person when a hunter Cuts apart his lesser cloaks and adds it to 
their R it is a proclamation of dominance when a hunter's cloak is emblazoned with the Insignia of 
their posy or faction they are proclaiming undying loyalty and when a hunter takes up the cloak of 
his Fallen comrade it is a vow and Cade vowed to honor the memory and sacrifice of his Fallen 
Friend And so not only did he take andle's cloak but he also volunteered to be the next Hunter 
Vanguard as time in the city age dragged on things slow slowly began to fall into Decay when 
the city's walls were constructed and finished there were eight towers that perched along its 
circumference each manned by Guardians frames fotc Force members and members of the stoneborn 
Titan order it was bristling with guns it was well defended but as the city age started to come to a 
close all but one of these towers had fallen into disrepair and had been abandoned the enemies of 
the city were beginning to blows in the time of the great City age heroes had seemingly come to 
an end an old and familiar kind of Darkness began to creep in from the edges of the system known at 
the time only to a select few including a single Cloud Strider known as Rohan who had found a back 
door into the black garden a terrible kernel of Darkness had been planted a false copy of the veil 
had been created a copy that had been nurtured by the Vex of the black garden and had been nothing 
but a source of poison for the traveler with this new darkness Rising and no one knowing of it 
the Traveler's light began to dim a warrior of great strength and resolve would be needed to 
deliver Humanity from the approaching Perils of this treacherous time and their prayers were 
answered one day a ghost continued its search for its Guardian trekking across the wastelands of 
the old cosmodrome at bonor the wastes that were now referred to as old Russia here amongst 
the rusting cars and unassuming bones of the collapse on a small hill just before the old 
cosmodrome walls they found something they found hope they found you and with you the whole 
world world would be changed forever [Music] oh h all not oh our journey began as Journeys do for Guardians 
in darkness until light night not some great and glorious thing filled with Triumph and Fanfare 
but a slow and steady thing like the rousing of a Great Hero after a long and well- earned Slumber 
we awoke to the sights of old Russia and the voice of our ghost and we realized that we knew nothing 
of our past when one of the worthy dead is chosen by a ghost and risen as a guardian of the light 
they remember nothing of their past lives some might get lucky and they might have an object 
from their person that identifies who they were it could be as simple as a name badge it could be 
something as extensive as a journal for those who are lucky enough but most of the time Guardians 
are risen with no idea of who they were and no connection to their past lives so it was for 
us we would have no conception of who we were and what we had done or why we were in Old Russia 
but it didn't matter the cosmodrome at bonor was a dangerous hunting ground and immediately we were 
being pursued by a squadron of Fallen Raiders our ghost would search through the wreckage and ruins 
until they found what they were looking for us but they were now not the only ones taking the risk 
we needed to escape and so narrowly evading the Fallen House of devil we found our way into the 
wall and found an old jump ship it had not been operated in hundreds of years perhaps it was 
Rusty and in need of repair but it would be enough to get us to the place we needed to go it 
would take us to the place we would one day call home the last City from a top the wall we took 
our first steps into the tower and we saw that we were surrounded by a company of many Heroes 
maybe it was here that we quietly made a choice to do good and to fight for these people people we 
didn't know yet people we had only just realized existed in This Strange World on the brink of 
collapse again if we made this decision in this moment that was perhaps our first true unspoken 
Act of heroism but it would not be our last after speaking with the Vanguard and listening to 
the speaker we knew our purpose as a guardian of the light we were bound to defend our home and 
our people lest all of Saul should fall into ruin the speaker warned us of an imminent threat that 
the darkness was coming back and that we would not survive it this time we would need to push 
back the darkness alongside with guardians on Earth and Beyond we would not know the face of 
this evil for some time and the speaker would die before he learned the truth but we would 
ride out to face this evil nonetheless and so we went forth we first returned to the cosmodrome 
where we acquired a jump drive for our ship from a fallen archon who had initially pursued us 
alongside the scouting team that found us his name was rexus and with his defeat the house of 
devils had suffered its first major blow at our hands we would also go on to defeat the high 
servator of the House of devils sepic Prime across the cosmodrome we first encountered The 
Hive and their Wizards who came from the moon but it was our discovery of Rasputin's remaining 
systems that would be most valuable through both Fallen meddling and the reactivation of an ancient 
communications array that we had discovered in a portion of the old war mined bunker system within 
old Russia the portion of Rasputin would be sent out to the rest of the system a portion that one 
day would be reunited with the whole presence was worth investigating further and so we followed 
their trail to the place that Guardians had long feared to Luna touching down on the surface of 
the Moon we were able to follow the signal of a guardian who had ventured here we followed their 
Trail until we discovered a massive pair of doors and a looming Hive structure before these doors 
the guardian was found and they were dead not even the light remained before the doors of this 
Temple to oro's son croa we saw what was left of them and briefly turned around there we saw our 
first glimpse of a stranger off in the distance watching us from Beyond but we had but moments 
to observe this the door in front of us began to unseal inside the hive would face us and we would 
discover the guardian's ghost this would also be the point at which we discovered the extent of 
the hive's presence on the moon for centuries they had been building up their forces and had 
been waiting to launch a full-scale invasion of Earth we delved deeper into the hive's secrets 
stealing from the world's grave the archive of the hive and defeating the Abominations that they 
raised in their summoning pits we shattered the remnants of cota's Sword to the darkest Edge and 
defeated a warden of or's shrine on the moon the deepest parts of this infestation were remarkable 
but the TR malice of the hive was unknown to us until the speaker contacted us out of the blue 
he stated that the hive were engaged in a ritual to drain the traveler of its light and so we 
rushed back to the Temple of croa where we had first descended into the hellmouth in that moment 
we were contacted yet again by that mysterious stranger on the ridge she sent us coordinates to 
a region of Venus known as the ishar sink which we would soon investigate and she promised us that 
if we were to defeat the Hive there were greater threats still to the system out there we returned 
to our mission and descended into the hive ritual chamber there we discovered what the hive were 
experimenting On A Shard of the traveler itself it was unclear how they were able to use this to 
manipulate the traveler and to drain its light but it did point to the idea that all shards 
of the traveler are somehow linked to it after successfully fre freeing The Shard of the traveler 
we went on our mission to Venus emboldened by our successes we found ourselves cutting through 
the overgrown ruins of the Ishtar Academy it was here that we first encountered another foe 
the Vex the time traveling Machines of Unknown Origin filled with millions of radial ARA after 
defeating them we met the EXO stranger at last to cut a long story shorter than was necessary she 
informed us that the traveler would not truly heal until we found the legendary black Garden's heart 
and ripped it out our ghost prompted us that the information we needed could only be found with the 
awoken they were the only ones who knew about the location of the black garden in possibly the 
most frustrating of terms The exost Stranger had little more to say to us after all she had no 
time to even explain why she didn't have time to explain but we at least at least had a heading and 
as she disappeared into nothingness we resolved to go to the black garden but first we would need 
to pay the awoken a visit and so we went out to the territory of the reef and were quickly picked 
up by the awoken Patrols in our initial somewhat Frosty reception with Prince Aldren and queen 
Mara we were told that if we recovered the eye of a Vex gate Lord they would Forge us a key into 
the black garden despite aldrin's insistence that this was a Fool's errand we began our search 
and returned to Venus along with discovering a golden age isar Collective lab and defeating 
the Kell of the Fallen House of winter we were able to pinpoint a location where we would find 
a Vex gate Lord a place called The endless steps as we ventured there we had to battle through many 
Vex frames to reach our Target zyron but even this powerful Vex gate Lord an axis mined in control 
of all the local Vex was not enough to stop us We Struck it down and took what remained of it to 
the queen alren begrudgingly obliged and ripped out the relevant components from the eye of 
the Vex gate Lord unfortunately the component was broken and would need to be charged in order 
to allow us Ingress into the black garden uldren gave us our less than functional prize and at 
Mara's request informed us that an entrance to the black garden could be found near Meridian Bay 
on Mars the queen also demanded that we would one day return to repay her generosity she had shown 
us Mercy given that we had barged into her kingdom and she would allow us to leave assuming that we 
returned when the time was right but that would have to wait until another day the Martian Sands 
were calling our name Meridian Bay was a heavily contested Zone when we arrived filled with cabal 
forces from the five scouting Legions that had invaded Saul pushing through them we first laid 
eyes on the gate to the black garden in a place called The Valley of the Kings now all we needed 
to do was properly fix the gate Lord's eye as we explored Mars for a way to do this we carved 
deep into Vex territory shutting down many of their portals that allowed them to exit from 
the black garden in great numbers we also had to contend with the cabal forces there and dealt 
many serious blows to them including taking out three of their Scion flares and even defeating 
the infamous valis to Ark who was stationed on the cabal land tank of the Cerberus V 3 alongside 
these great defeats we also discovered something remarkable we found Rasputin again the same 
fragment of him that we had aided in the cosmodrome he was here as well within the warmin 
systems of Meridian Bay he was starting to regrow in terms of strength soon perhaps he would be 
ready to fight once more eventually though our ghost would would discover our true objective a 
means of charging the gate Lord's eye a massive Vex Spire deep in cabal territory would be are 
in this particular fire base where the Spire was located was controlled by Elite Vex clearing units 
of the Kabal blind Legion and their Primus didn't take kindly to his territory being invaded But we 
managed to defeat him and successfully interfaced the gate Lord's eye with the Spire all that 
remained was to return to the Valley of the Kings and enter the black garden itself as we 
approached the gate Vex poured forth and the Gateway reacted to us we defeated them and crossed 
over we found ourselves in a strange place a world of stone and brass and Moss ancient Vex frames 
stood here motionless covered in the growth of the garden these were the soul divisive the Vex 
that lay Within in the black garden itself they had seen the Divinity planted here by the witness 
not long ago and had sought to bind themselves to it for their own Survival that Divinity would 
be what we faced at the black Garden's heart unbeknownst to us at the time this roing formless 
mass of Darkness was a copy of the veil a floored copy that had begun to poison the traveler with 
its imperfection as we stepped forth we saw the Vex frames doing as they did within the presence 
of this unknown Divinity they had decided that the greatest means by which they could survive was 
worship and so they had reverently decided to enact the behavior of worship bowing eternally 
to this new feted thing we saw the Vex frames leaving this state of worship and reacting to us 
and in their adoration some of them were empowered by Darkness three great Vex axis mindes known 
as the soul progeny were calcified into statues before this black heart each of them representing 
the past present or future they would all come to life one at a time empowered by the black Garden's 
heart but with its power attached to each of these Vex the heart was weakened each time we struck 
one down and when the last mind fell the heart began to collapse in on itself in a great torrent 
of cascading energy as the light from this moment overwhelmed our senses and blinded our eyes the 
heart was destroyed the destruction of the heart of the black garden would send Echoes out Across 
the Universe and would set in motion everything that followed the Traveler's light would begin to 
return and slowly it would start to heal itself at last as we returned to the city to celebrate our 
success we were greeted One Last Time by The exost Stranger she gave us her weapon and reminded us 
that there were more foes that we would soon need to confront the words and Whispers would send us 
forth and we would pursue the rumors of the dark power that the Vex had sought to unleash from the 
black garden that trail would lead us to the most infamous Vault of Glass the fire team that had 
tried to raid the Vault before us was lost mostly to time little is known of the EXA details of the 
assault of bahanan prith and Kabir but we do know that their ill-fated attempt to destroy the Hazen 
Lords was unsuccessful what we found within the Vault was the remains of Kabir the Eis the last 
vestage of his light and we would put it to Great use using it to break the unbreakable within the 
Vault to assault this great stronghold though we would need to face Vex with true control over time 
itself the power of these Vex was ontological in nature they would be able to cut the threads of 
the timelines themselves here within the Vault a unique power vested in this place alone to put 
it simply if you were removed from the timeline here it would be as if you never existed at all 
to fail was not simply to die it was to never have been in the first place we faced down their 
great constructs including the Templar the Gorgon and the greatest of them all aeon times conflux 
defeating these Vex would undo their control of the Vault and leave it as an empty shell 
of what was our first great conquests were complete but many more battles awaited us 
the Resurgence of the light had drawn the attention of others of those that lay on the moon 
of those with envious eyes and hungry slathering Jaws even as we had struck down the heart of 
the black garden and attained our first great Victory our actions on the moon had roused a 
slumbering giant croa the son of orex had seen the return of the light's power and would 
begin to Marshall his forces on the moon and on Earth this would be the Prelude to what 
would be an invasion well over a century in the making all of the forces that we had discovered 
on the moon would soon be sent onward to invade Earth and to destroy the last City but a remnant 
of cota's past persisted still a Remnant that would be the bane of him and all of his kin for 
long ago six of them went down into the pit and now ragged and scarred but enlightened and 
determined one would crawl out Eris mourn the last she would quickly find a vessel and make her 
way back to the last City but her return was not the happy reunion that some might have hoped for 
her time in the hellmouth had left her changed and having lost her sight long ago and having had 
to replace it with the of an acolyte she was seen as a terrible Abomination a thing of Darkness her 
ghost Brier was gone her connection to the light was severed and now she wept an eternal veil of 
Shadows like blood drifting through droplets of rain the speaker and Commander ofala wanted to 
immediately Exile her but Aris had been a member of Aura Ray organization known as the hidden the 
great order of spies and Scouts that iora used us to keep tabs on the system at large at her request 
Aris mourn was allowed to remain Aris immediately sought us out and told us of the coming invasion 
of croa to counter it we headed to the cosmodrome first cot's disciples were making their Landings 
there and so we needed to blunt the offensive before it could truly begin we went to kill sardon 
the fist of croa and to prevent omigle cota's will from corrupting the syst of the warmind Rasputin 
that were found within old Russia the seraphim bunkers beneath the surface were held and the 
hive were not able to use the war min's weapons against us rebuking these assaults would leave 
cota's immediate Invasion plan halted it broke the tip of his spear seizing on this momentum we 
would return to the moon and defeated the son of orex for the first time we would discover croa 
initially in the darkest ritual chamber of the hellmouth the Chamber of night but we would 
not face Cotter as he had been in the great disaster we would face a weakened fragment of 
his power long ago a hive Knight of Zorra had clashed with another Knight bearing tribute for 
cota's father orx and by extension as part of that chain cro himself both Knights died and 
their tithes never reached their overlords in the case of croa who would have tithed this 
Knight's portion to orex it meant that he believed he needed to retreat to regain his power in 
this crystalline form so that he could safely be manifested again when he was Stronger trapped 
within this crystalline Matrix and unable to take true physical form without the intervention of his 
brood croa was vulnerable and despite his still overwhelming power we proved more than a match 
for him and shattered his Crystal banishing him from this Mortal plain his initial assaults on 
the moon might have been stopped but as one of the ascendant Hive as the son of orx no less Proto 
was uniquely positioned to survive death he would only truly die if he was destroyed within his own 
Throne World thanks to the teachings of toand the shattered arism knew this and she asked us to 
assemble a team to do what she had tried many years ago to do what the others had failed to to 
end croa once and for all and to secure Vengeance for waying Arana 3 saota Omar AAR velalo and toand 
the shattered once again six of us went down into the pit and this time we would not crawl out we 
would go deeper we fell at the the heart of the hellmouth we fell into the Stills where Ariana 
and toand had once seen the light of cot's nether realm for themselves we battled through cota's 
seemingly endless hordes to reach the keyhole the Gateway that led into The Nether Realm of the son 
of orex on the other side we were greeted with a green flame Sky beneath the overs Soul throne and 
we would face croa the son of or's one last time though his might was remarkable and his strength 
was boundless we fought the hive god with strength that he himself would muster with the logic of 
the sword the immutable rule of the universe that the hive had learned so long ago that Only 
the Strong shall live and that the weak will die and what's more we would Triumph we took cot's own 
sword the darkest Edge and pul plunged it into the son of or's heart in his final desperate moments 
as his cries rang out across the night the Sea of Screams shivered when cot's cry was ended silence 
but something out in the night had heard him soon it would be upon us but till that moment arrived 
we would believe this to be our greatest Victory and the Vengeance that would soon stalk us from 
across the Stars would not arrive in the system for at least a few months more and in this time 
there were other concerns for us to deal with we were called back to the black garden to deal 
with a new Vex axis mind called the undying mind it was attempting to return the heart of the 
black garden to life needless to say we could not stand for such a thing and so we shut it down for 
good but the Echoes of this mysterious construct would still persist in the infinite weave 
of time that was the black garden just like the other Soul divisive Vex these Vex would bide 
their time until an opportunity presented itself once more and back in the system there were 
other forces on the Move strange happenings were occurring out in the asteroid belt and soon 
the queen would call on us for that favor we owed her it is not a common thing for the 
awoken of the reef to seek out assistance it is even rarer for them to seek it out from 
the likes of Guardians and yet marov had seen how we had dispatched with the son of 
orx and so we had at least proven our competence in battle and that competence was 
needed skolas the Kell of the House of wolves whom Mara had defeated in The Reef Wars had 
broken out of the prison of Elders the exact details of this breakout aren't known but it 
appears to be with the assistance of the nine why they did this is something of a mystery but 
what we do know is that they gifted skolas with a catch one of the great Fallen warships with this 
he had an opportunity to call his forces back to his side many corsairs of the awoken would die in 
the ensuing chaos and a few Infamous Fallen wolves that would come to be known as the queen Breakers 
even attempted an assassination on marasol herself corsair's died in her defense there and her 
Fury was palpable as the traitors turned tail and fled Mara tasked us and her recently appointed 
Queen's wroth Petra venge with hunting down skolas and all the treacherous wolves we would also be 
assisted by varx the loyal the same scribe of house judgment who had originally betrayed skolas 
we quickly discovered that his Fallen wolves were converging on the simic fell the Kon Venus that 
had once housed the leadership of the House of winter namely the Winter's Kell draxis we briefly 
interrupted skolas making a proclamation before the crew of this catch VAR translated this and as 
it turned out skolis was proclaiming himself to be an elix Legend the so-called Kell of Kells who 
would unite all the elix houses have all ctors and catches bent to him him and even receive the 
blessing of the traveler itself before we could defeat skolas and put an end to such delusions of 
grandure he escaped and had succeeded in rallying what remained of the House of winter our first 
mission was a failure but we didn't let that stop us quickly we managed to pick up his Trail 
again and we would head to Earth in order to cut skolas off he was heading there to try and 
integrate the forces of the House of devils and of Kings into his growing armies using either 
force or diplomacy but our arrival in both cases scuffed all of skolas his plans before they could 
even bear fruit with pressure being put upon the wolf Kell and with no other houses to turn 
to in the system of significant enough power skolas looked for other means of conquering 
his Foe and his Madness could be seen here he desperately sought out an advantage from the Vex 
he made a small raid into the the now weakened Vault of Glass and successfully tapped into 
some of the Vex technology there a testament to his Madness and the skill of his splices who 
even deployed a few weakened oracles to try and wipe us from existence with the danger skolas 
presented Rising it was becoming incredibly important for us to capture him with all haste his 
forces were raiding more V installations including the ominous Citadel on Venus the massive Vex 
Spire that pierced Towards the Sky they were hoping to use its technology for their advantage 
unfortunately for skolas his movement to the top of the Citadel had left him cornered we ascended 
to the top of the Spire at the very height of the Citadel and there we battled with the kill of 
wolves even as he used Vex technology to pull his house through time skolas was outmatched and fell 
before us he was captured by marov and Petra renge and he was promptly returned to the prison 
of Elders the wolf kale would stand trial but not before being interrogated by varx and 
Mara skolas told them in a moment of fear that despite the malice they had dealt to him there 
was an even greater force headed this way a dark and looming shadow that would crush all with its 
presence later Mara would prophetically dream of this foe she saw what was to come and knew knew 
that it could spell her doom and the Doom of the whole system many envoys went back and forth from 
The Reef in those days in particular aism Osiris and marov would all meet convening to discuss 
the threat that they would soon encounter but more than simply this the three would discuss the 
nature of the Ultimate Enemy that they would need to confront lest they should witness its wroth for 
themselves and thus a plan of loose cooperation was devised between the three of them and a plan 
to address orx was formed it would be a plan of many steps and phases one that would evolve and 
shape its foundations over time but it would first be set into motion months later by Marv's choices 
over the rings of Saturn and its consequences would Echo across the ascendant Realms forever 
but before such plans could be enacted there was one last complication to deal with skolas was 
still alive given what approached on the horizon The Reef could ill afford a second breakout and 
so in the ways of old of the elix the wolf Cal was sentenced to trial by combat we would be his 
Chosen executioners and so we entered the prison of Elders and fought the hordes of skolas minions 
who had been imprisoned there the wolf kale was fierce and did everything his power to destroy 
us but we had already destroyed gods in our short time as Guardians even with his many tricks 
and his minions being flung at us left right and Center this Pretender Prophet this socalled Kell 
of Kells was nothing more than a charlatan he was no mat for our light skolas the rabbit would be 
vanquished the wolf Kell was no more for a short time things seemed calm across the system and we 
reinforced preparing for our next battle little did we know that what we would soon be engulfed in 
was no battle but a war a war against one of the greatest champions of the darkness that the system 
had known since the collapse for only recently we had slain croa and his death rattle had echoed 
out across the night and now the night would answer it started with a presence a movement of 
unknown vessels that were quickly identified by the awoken cot's father had heard his cries and 
despite the teachings of the sword logic orex would seek revenge for the death of his son he 
had brought his Armada he had brought his brood worst of all he had brought his dreadn it was 
the awoken who would encounter him first marasol marshaled her fleets and the many catches under 
her command she met the king out in the edges of the system and at the rings of Saturn the two 
monarchs did battle as The Fleets engaged the combat at first seemed even until Mara Unleashed 
her her harbingers like she had done in the reef Wars these ancient anomalous creatures brought 
with them the same devastating force of gravity that they had before and or's fleet was crushed 
between the debris of sadden Rings the harbingers slammed into or's dreadn leaving the rest of the 
hive Fleet in disarray but the dreadn still stood unblemished now it was or's turn to unleash his 
own Force using the dreadnots mighty weapon orex projected his own Throne world into real space 
Mara's fleet was crushed she was taken her teans were taken and as they attempted to flee into the 
dreaming City or's corruption spread forth across the system and through the Gap that they had 
tried to use to escape or's Echoes would spread out across the system and found their way into 
many places pieces of power they took Hazen Vex within the Vault of Glass they took powerful covs 
of witches on Earth there were fleeting steps made by these Echoes into the resurfaced black garden 
and they even ventured into the dreaming City where through one of his Echoes orx would speak 
to Riven of a thousand voices the last known aamar after a brief bargain of sorts the wish Dragon 
herself was taken as well thus orx proclaimed his arrival in Saul thus ended the Battle of Saturn 
thus began the taken War we would first learn of it when we saw massive cabal Fleet movements 
from the sky burner's base on Phobos we went to investigate and discovered that this was not 
the cabal forces marshalling it was an evacuation it didn't take long for us to discover the taken 
for ourselves and we barely escaped before being overrun the Vanguard quickly convened to analyze 
the threat and thanks to Aris they to would learn of orx being one for decisive action Cade had 
a plan one which he immediately contacted us to enact we went to one of Cade's old stashes 
in Old Russia to recover ancient stealth Drive technology stolen from Rasputin even here on Earth 
the taken was starting to make their appearances it was here that we faced our first echo of the 
taken King himself after recovering the drive we took it to Cade who installed it on AIS mn's ship 
Aris wouldn't fly the vessel herself that honor would be ours to undertake but the vessel was 
ideal for this Mission with the stealth Drive installed and with it still covered in Hive 
detritus it stood the best chance of masking itself from hive detection and getting us close 
enough to board or's dreadnut shut down his super weapon and prepare a landing zone for Guardians 
to invade which is exactly what we did though we discovered that the stealth drive and eris's ship 
weren't exactly going to make a return Journey we also realized that we weren't the only Invaders 
as the cabal skyburners had crashed one of their vessels the dantali in Exodus 6 into the dread 
norts Hull as part of a general boarding action and response to Phobos after we'd secured a 
landing Zone we had to go after orx an idea that these cabal had also had in mind the Primus 
of the skyburners was pushing deep into the dreadn with his forces orex put a stop to his throne 
breaking Ambitions by taking him and thus the cabal forces were mostly shattered it was also 
here that we discovered the way deeper into oro's dreadn and also that it was blocked it could only 
be accessed by certain ascendant Hive we were at a dead end but Aris still had a plan we didn't 
need to actually be an ascendant Hive we just had to pass as one in order to accomplish this we 
were going to have to go back to the place where we had defeated our first great ascendant Hive we 
would need to return to the places where we had killed croa both in his throne world and on the 
moon first we would would need a Shard of Crystal that we had destroyed in the Chamber Of Night upon 
reaching it we had to fight off B the gravekeeper a powerful ogre who was guarding this site given 
his failure to defend it he was also taken when he was starting to lose his battle with us orex 
clearly had other plans for him in mind as we recovered this Shard of Crystal orex Unleashed 
his taken in an ambush attempting to stamp us out for good he nearly succeeded but thanks to our 
Swift exit we were unharmed we also briefly raided one of Rasputin's bunkers to recover another 
copy of the stealth technology that Cade had used this time from an actual underground part 
of Rasputin's Network this was all being done for the next part of our infiltration prot's 
Throne world was heavily guarded now and a death ceremony was being hosted to send cro Soul 
onto the next Realm from there we would need to infiltrate the ceremony and steal some of cot's 
essence indwelling it within the Cristal or's two daughters were present oruk and Oak were 
praying at the side of their brother's tomb and when we started to steal the brother's Essence 
the two reacted violently the transgression of our light here was quite the insult we would have been 
snuffed out but thankfully Eris mourn was able to help help us Escape using some of the hive's own 
magic to pull us out we now had all we needed to confront orx and so we returned to the dreadnut 
and passed through into the Sacred Space where the altar of orx could be found there we would 
find the taken Primus and back the gravekeeper once again they would be our final test before we 
faced orx himself before or's altar we found the taken King and in this place of Darkness we would 
fight and match our light to his shadow it would have been a hardfought battle but regardless 
of or's Millennia of Conquest our light was stronger in the moment of his defeat he channeled 
his power and took himself cheating his death and allowing him to pass back into the deepest parts 
of his throne world all that remained of the taken King was his sword will breaker from this sword 
Aris took a Shard and gave it to us it would take time and guidance from Lord Shacks as well as 
a large amount of a purified hadium alloy from The Dread nort but eventually The Shard of wheel 
breaker was purified and would be infused with our light allowing us to wield our own Mighty 
blade in the final moments of its creation we would need to destroy ecar the blade of orx this 
symbolic Conquest reforged or's old blade from a thing of Darkness into a thing of light armed 
with this new tool we would prepare to conquer the rest of the dreadn we defeated a potential 
successor to orex a dark blade known as alakul in the hanging Crypts we prevented the agonarch 
coven from raising a great taken Abomination and unleashing it upon the system we prevented a pair 
of bond brothers from destroying The Dread nut's core and half the system along with it and we set 
our sights on or's court in this place we would destroy many of his ascendants preventing them 
from tiing their strength to their King weakening him further because make no mistake orx was still 
alive in his throne world he lived on and was more powerful still there than he had been in the 
physical world before we entered that Throne world we would need to crush the taken remnants 
out in the system the taken war was not yet won we had to dislodge covens of Taken gathering 
on Earth before they could root deep within our home we returned to the Vault of Glass where 
the taken infestation had forced the Vex into an unusual position they had to return prith to our 
timeline momentarily so that he might guide us in and defeat the taken infestation on Mars the taken 
were at risk of overrunning the now surfaced black garden which had momentarily been dimensionally 
locked to Mars's Surface after our destruction of the black Garden's heart finally we returned 
to the first place where we encountered the taken and on Phobos we fought them there as well 
they were strongest here but we carved away the infection before it could truly threaten Saul any 
further with his minions scattered and his armies in chaos orx was left weakened all we had left to 
do was to Dethrone the king himself we assembled a fire team and struck out into the heart of the 
dread nort orex was our Target but by passing into the dread nord's heart we would also need to 
face or Rex's remaining retainers the king's War priest was engaged in ritual combat and by killing 
this Millennia old Destroyer we were able to gain further Ingress but we took an unexpected forward 
path venturing through a portal summoned after the war priest's defeat we found ourselves 
in Gogo's Cellar where ORS kept drafts of slowly corrupting light for consumption like fine 
vintages or artworks painted in suffering here we found and defeated garoth an ogre corrupted with 
the power of the hive and the worm Gods an ogre who had been created to tithe violence to orx to 
corrupt The Light Within the cellar and to contain one of the tablets of Ruin within its flesh after 
defeating this monster we would progress further and eventually we ascended to the final Overlook 
here we slew or's two daughters the death singers o halak and Ur ANUK there was no alternative for 
the taken King but to face us he would destroy us by the right of the sword or he would die trying 
his power was all but certain here Titanic in form orex attempted to crush us with all the might at 
his disposal but by using the corrupted light and detonating it we were able to burn away oro's 
darkness and send the taken King screaming back into the void as his final scream rang out across 
the Stars yet again just as had been the case with his son a terrible silence fell over the ascendant 
plain it fell over the whole dreadn the whole of the system and this time nothing would answer all 
of creation could breathe a sigh of relief for we had defeated orex the taken King unknowingly we 
had set further events in motion with this we had sent signals to the rest of the hive Pantheon and 
the rest of the hive swarms the King was now dead the the light had triumphed or's sisters and 
the great subjugator rol the first disciple of the witness would take notice of our actions 
though we would not see their plans unfold for many years with the death of the taken King 
we also had the chance to recover three strange artifacts the blade of famine from the war priest 
the shroud of Uruk from the daughter of orx and to the taken King's own r heart alongside these our 
investigations in the dreadn had allowed us to recover the calcified fragments when the over 50 
of them were fully assembled these fragments gave us the knowledge of the first five books of sorrow 
and led us on the path to the weapon that orx had conceived of long ago with his ravenous heart 
his daughter's shroud and his War priest's blade Aris mour forged a weapon unlike any other the 
remnants of or's soul and purpose made manifest the touch of malice with this powerful weapon 
in hand Guardians had begun to feel somewhat Unstoppable but there were more troubling events 
still unfolding having lost all their commanders the remaining cabal aboard the dantalian Exodus 
6 were sending out a distress signal we rushed to the heart of the carrier's Command Deck to try 
and stop them but it was already too late the message had been sent out into deep space and it 
was requesting reinforcements the message receiver at the time being was unknown to us but we did 
know that it had been sent to the ruler of the cabal Empire that ruler would be Dominus Gaul the 
one who would arrive soon and change the system forever but it would take a full year for him 
to Marshall his forces and reach Saul and before he did arrive Guardians would have to face a new 
threat from an old enemy the house of Devils were on the March and this time they had discovered a 
weapon that would change the fates of the system [Music] forever approximately a year after the 
defeat of the taken King Lord Saladin summoned us to the cosmodrome in particular to an old 
snowcovered mountain with an abandoned Fortress at its Summit little did we know that this 
would be some of the holiest and most storied ground Guardians could set foot upon we stro out 
onto the mountain and for the first time entered fell winter Peak the mountain was being raided 
by the house of devils and whilst Saladin was still trying to find find out why we were able 
to fend off the Invaders but we did discover something strange it was sepic Prime the same 
servator that we had destroyed 2 years ago but this time it was different it was changed covered 
in a strange red and black mechanical growth like a plague of machines like infections like tumors 
and somehow any damage we were doing to sepic it would degenerate upon reporting this to Saladin he 
exclaimed with shock and demanded that we destroy the construct with all haste sepex escaped in 
the end and as we secured the iron temple with Saladin the hunter Shiro 4 and the crypto tyan 
our next objective would be to pursue sepex who had retreated into a previously sealed off section 
of the cosmodrome as we pursued the servator we saw the source of it infection sver the nanite 
technology that Rasputin had used to kill the iron Lords all those years ago the house of devils 
had found it and their splicers had weaponized it turning many of their soldiers into cyborgs in 
the view of the Fallen to become a machine is to become a God and so with sver the devil splicers 
had discovered a source of divinity itself a means by which apotheosis could be achieved it it also 
made them far deadlier than they already were pushing deeper into the plagu lands we discovered 
that the Devils had used sver in all sorts of ways not only modifying themselves but also their 
forces and any of the cosmodromes old defenses that were still inactive which could be repaired 
using sver these guns were powerful enough to threaten the city and so while they were active 
incoming reinforcements could not be dispatched we had to destroy them immedi mediately whilst we 
succeeded in this task it was starting to become clear that the Devils were a far deadlier threat 
than we had initially realized and their grasp of sver was starting to accelerate Saladin 
would bring us back to the temple and would tell us of the iron Lord's history with SIA this 
exchange revealed to us that the house of devils had control of SIA in a rudimentary sense they 
did not fully have Mastery over the nanites for the moment with that in mind we Tracked Down the 
original source of sea thanks to the assistance of the crypto tyan and returned to the Golden Age 
Labs of Clovis Bray in Freehold on Mars after confirming that it was there on Mars that the 
Devils had learned how to control CA we would be able to discover a weakness in the mechanism used 
by the Devils to control the nanites returning to the plag lands we had our objectives shirou had 
devised a means of tempor temporarily halting the devil's control over sver and shutting down 
their defenses for a few minutes after we had sabotaged their systems we would descend beneath 
the main base of the elix the splicers had built up an area into a massive Fortress and siver's 
destabilization had caused it to start detonating regardless of the danger the splicers were 
undeterred and so we descended past the archon's forge deep into sight six where the iron Lords had 
met their end this was the sea replication complex and we had to destroy it for good this time but 
in the deepest reaches of this place there was a faint echo of light falling from the infestation 
we saw what had become of the iron Lords as the infested and Bloated remains of felwinter gon 
and yaler Rose to fight against us their light was entangled with C an nanites which now returned 
to the purpose Rasputin had given them so long ago replicate eliminate immunize we battled with the 
remnants of the iron Lords and destroyed the SE nanites that infested them freeing their light 
and finally laying them to rest before we left we recovered Yola's helmet and set sight six to 
self-destruct it isn't known if if all the sver within the complex was truly destroyed inert sver 
may still be lying around the cosmodrome to this day but for the moment the Devils were unable to 
make more of their own nanites to control they would only have the stocks that they had made 
thus far we returned Yola's helmet to saladan who felt a weight of so many years lifted from his 
shoulders his friends had finally been set to rest he proclaimed us to be the Young Wolf the first of 
a new age of iron Lords and gifted us with a blade to represent our new title and station we would go 
out into the plaguelands and start to rid them of the infestation of the splices we destroyed the 
rejuvenated version of sepic prime and ended a splice a priest called kovic before he could merge 
cver with an entire brood of Hive we reignited radagast's original Pur purp Us by using sver and 
the armor of the iron Lords to create the tools of a better tomorrow namely we used them to forge 
a new a more powerful iteration of the infamous yalah horn the hold of the House of Devil's 
splices was weakening but Shiro 4 picked up something distressing an intercepted transmission 
from the house of devils indicated that there was a secondary complex where the Devils had been 
storing the SE nanites that they had gathered from from within the leader of the splicers was 
calling out to all other Fallen encouraging them to gather in the so-called Perfection complex 
where they could be freed from their mortal bonds with this message and the large buildup 
of the industrial base in the plag lands that the elix had been working so hard to create it was 
clear that soon the Fallen would build up enough strength to threaten the lost city again this 
was something the city was unlikely to survive with the power of sver the Fallen had something 
they could potentially use to strike back at the Lesser Guardians and there were not enough 
Legends within the tower to hold back an assault of this strength so shirro seeing this plot unfold 
before him ordered us to kill it in its crib we engaged in a coordinated raid on the facility 
and a preemptive strike we would take out the spc's leadership before they could gather enough 
strength to actually threaten the city we quickly infiltrated the facility and discovered the spc's 
second in command Vosk his command over the sea was powerful but Rogue sea nanites had started to 
persist within the Swarms and the Guardians would weaponize these nanites turning them on their 
masters bringing Vosk down we ascended through the old Russian wall next and discovered a way to its 
Summit there we saw proof of the fallin's intent and ambition a powerful prototype Siege engine 
powered by nuclear components such a mighty device would have been powerful enough to Break Down 
The Walls of the last City and so we had to see to its destruction after overcharging it we saw 
to its Doom by sending it tumbling down off the incomplete section of the cosmodrome walls where 
it crashed into the Seas below as we approached the Perfection complex the sea infestation was 
getting stronger but the Ragged Fallen kit bashing had started to give way smooth angular nanite 
construction now filled these Halls the seat of the power of these Fallen splices was near as 
we descended into the darkness of the Perfection complex we faced axis the archon prime he had not 
just combined himself with the machines he had ascended into one leaving behind his biological 
self and truly achieving the elix version of godhood but this Pretender was no match for the 
light of Guardians and there was little that could be done to stop us even with the command 
of the cver itself we brought down axis and after thoroughly scouting the Perfection complex we 
recovered another relic of sver which could be reconstituted into a weapon that used the nanites 
as ammunition we would call it out break Prime and whilst it was eventually contained by the Crypt 
Archy for a brief time we used it to sew chaos amongst the ranks of the splicers with our victory 
over axis and all other threats seemingly gone from the system there was a brief period of Peace 
it was declared to be an age of Triumph it was declared to be a time for Humanity to celebrate 
their Guardians and the successes that they had accomplished but beneath this age of Triumph 
signs of what was to come could be seen it started with the Fallen they had begun doing something 
unheard of they had begun shredding their banners and fleeing into the deeper Wilds the state of 
existence within which the city had lived known as The hundred-year Siege would come to a brief end 
there weren't enough elix assaulting the various walls for it to be considered a Siege anymore 
and the cabal Scout Legions began marshalling for reinforcements that we should have been 
preparing for ourselves our age of Triumph was short-lived and would be brought Crashing 
Down by the arrival of a foe unlike any other he understood our power and he would seek to deprive 
us of it so that we would be left defenseless the red Legion was coming the call of the dantalian 
exit 6 had been answered and at the head of the invasion Fleet stood the principal instigator 
of the the midnight coup ruler of the cabal Empire and the first ever Dominus soon we would 
face Gaul and he would not have mercy for our [Music] light there were some warning signs of 
ghoul's approach but we were blind to them and so the red War began with a swift allout assault 
on the last City the walls that had held back the Fallen for a 100 years were shattered in mere 
moments the cabal fleet left the tower in ruin and rained drop pods on our home from above 
at the head of their Fleet a massive looming vessel began to unfold and made its way toward 
the traveler unfurling into a truly massive structure we would not know its purpose at the 
time but all too soon we would see that it would spell our Doom we returned to the tower from the 
Wilds after coming back from a patrol and saw the devastation firsthand our vaults were destroyed 
our home was crippled and in the opening moments of the war the cabal had captured the speaker 
after pushing through through the tower we rued with the Vanguard and Amanda holiday who 
shepherded us up to the Kabul command carrier we were able to disable it briefly but as we 
fled to the top deck we saw that we were too late the vessel had attached to the side of the 
traveler and as we wondered at its purpose we saw him Dominus GA the ghost Primus of the 
red Legion he told us to Behold our future and the cage activated we were cut off from our 
light our ghost fell to our side motionless our powers were gone Gaul proclaimed our weakness 
and our unworthiness before kicking us from his Command Ship our drained ghost fell with us down 
into the ruins of the last city that we had failed to protect we fell into unconsciousness and all 
seemed lost but out of the darkness a faint light flickered we saw a vision of a Silver Hawk in 
Flight we saw visions of new weapons of light and new challenges that we might face the vision ended 
with a view of A Shard of the traveler in a place we had never been to a place we would know one 
day as the European dead zone and then we awoke lightless we struggled to our feet we were in the 
ruins of a city canal and thus far we had been able to evade the cabal we found our ghost and we 
had to choose the only option that was available to us we could not face the cabal in this state 
and so we fled for weeks we treed across mountains and through valleys we passed the bodies of our 
fallen comrades and eventually we saw a familiar sight a hawk just like the ones from the Visions 
we followed it through mountains and passes until at last we collapsed from exhaustion when we next 
awoke a woman was bringing us to our feet the hawk was hers her name was Sariah Hawthorne and 
she lived out here in the Wilds she escorted us to a safe haven in The Dead Zone called the farm 
and there we reunited with another familiar face Tyra Khan she instructed us to follow our vision 
with caution as the area around The Shard of the traveler had been converted into a dark Forest 
by the Wayward Light Of The Shard following our only hope we pushed through Fallen Marauders 
and held close to our ghost as we reached the Luminous Shard our ghost felt the Traveler's 
presence once more and was filled with light in a cascading array of returning power we felt our 
strength build once more we were not empowered in the same way as we had been but once again we were 
blessed with immortality and we could wield the light as a weapon once more our new found powers 
would represent a turning point in the red War we were the only Guardian in existence to have 
recovered our light but we had to make the most of it we were the last trick up the sleeve of all 
the Guardians in the last City and so we needed to get to work after clearing up Hawthorne's 
Communications we picked up a transmission from Zavala commanding all remaining Guardian forces to 
rally on Titan when we ventured there we found the remnants of the tower's military in disarray The 
Archies were infested with hive and we would have to secure the platforms before we could properly 
reunite with Zavala after doing so we would be able to take our first steps against the cabal the 
forces on Titan had intercepted a multitude of red Legion Transmissions using one of the Golden Age 
CPU CES from within the archology we would be able to decode those transmissions and discern the 
best way to strike back it was also there that we discovered one of the deepest recesses in the 
lower decks of the archology just as we acquired the CPU core we stopped and saw a giant looming 
Shadow just outside of the observation deck there was something magnificently large in Titan's 
oceans the Leviathan the likes of which we had never seen this was technically the first time 
we had seen Assa the Proto hiive worm God that had escaped the witness and fundament though we 
didn't know it at the time we were beholding one of the greatest signs of hope that we would ever 
lay our eyes upon we didn't have time to Marvel at her passing though we had to escape with the core 
unfortunately the secrets it decoded left little good news along with the cage the red Legion had 
brought another massive construct with their Fleet a space station known as the almighty this station 
was capable of devouring planets but it did so for an even more destructive purpose using its core 
weapon system the almighty could be used to cause a star to prematurely go supernova even if the 
cabal lost they could destroy all of Saul and wipe Humanity from the face of existence even with this 
dire news zavala's resolve wasn't broken he sought to reunite his fire team and to take back the last 
City no matter the cost so our next objective was clear we had to go and find the other fire team 
members of the Vanguard which meant going after Cade 6 fortuitously with the CPU in hand we 
were able to intercept various other signals from around the system and one of them would be a 
signal from Cade's ghost Sundance that signal Drew us to a planetoid called nessus here we discovered 
that Kate had been Tangled in some Vex technology that he didn't completely understand there was o a 
colony ship that had crashed here The Exodus black one of the Exodus program vessels from so long 
ago its crew were all dead save for the onboard AI fail safe thanks to fail safe's assistance we 
were able to save Cade and we discovered that the technology he was attempting to lift from the Vex 
was a teleporter short range but still capable of being used within the last City to get close 
enough to assassinate dominous G that was Cade's plan at least but to execute it we'd need to be 
able to truly reunite the Vanguard and Cade would not be doing this alone so we had to go and find 
aora Cade told us that she almost certainly made her way out to IO a sacred place for warlocks as 
it was the last place the traveler had touched before the collapse began when we met iora we 
also found the red Legion and we quickly discerned their Pur purpose at the Cradle where the traveler 
had sat down they were trying to drain the light from IO light which bloomed from the planet's 
core in a latent fashion in the wake of the traveler the red Legion were draining all of it 
we had to prevent the red legion's sacrilege and in the process we also discerned their plans they 
weren't just draining the light so that they could prevent us from having it they were trying to take 
the light for themselves the taken population on iO also converged on the red Legions experiments 
amongst their number observing the cabal and the Guardians alike were a few envoys of yet another 
dark figure in the background savathun the witch Queen showed her hand for the first time on iO her 
forces Marshal and kept a watchful eye on us as we did what our work demanded though we wouldn't 
know the witch Queen's purpose until far later so suffice to say her observations of the cabal and 
the Guardians fighting over light now make a lot more sense ioro was starting to formulate a plan 
even though she had only been back with our fire team for a brief amount of time we realized that 
in order to discover more about the Almighty we would need to leverage one of the oldest Assets 
in the system a warmind bunker that was still active on iO we would be able to use its systems 
to scan the almighty for a weakness from here we determined that we couldn't simply destroy the 
almighty as it would take the sun with it instead we would need to board to the station and sabotage 
its main weapon with this knowledge in hand we reunited the members of the Vanguard at the farm 
back in the edz the plan would be to engage the red Legion in a two-pronged assault the Vanguard 
would engage in the initial attack on the last City and would focus on getting the Vex teleporter 
as close to Gaul as possible when we had disabled the Almighty we would rendevu with them and 
use the teleporter to get close enough to Gul to assassinate him ourselves it was a risky plan 
but it was our only realistic hope but in order to board the Almighty we would need to commandeer a 
command vessel from the cabal and there was only realistically one option we needed to steal the 
personal shuttle of one of G's chosen a warrior known as thumos The Unbroken we dislodged him from 
his personal command carrier the orbas vectura in the edz and proved that his name was in fact not 
well earned just as quickly the plan had to be initiated we boarded thumos ship and boarded the 
almighty it was already in the process of charging and was consuming the planet of Mercury for fuel 
we fought our way to its core disabled it and allowed the assault on the last City to begin but 
all this time as we had been Gathering our allies and as we had been fleeing to find our light once 
more Gaul had also been planning his capture of the speaker ala leader at the beginning of the war 
meant that he had an extensive amount of time to interrogate him about the nature of the light 
Gaul made his desire clear to be chosen by the traveler and even though the speaker had pushed 
back against him his resolve was starting to break the consul the other member of the midnight coup 
who had led the overthrow of Emperor callus had also with the red Legion and was counseling Gaul 
stating that he did not need to be chosen by the traveler that he instead could do as the 
legendary acrius had done and simply claim the light by force this disagreement as well as 
the speaker admission that the traveler wasn't explicitly communicating with him would lead to 
a moment of utter rage the consul would leave the speaker dead and in response to him being called 
weak Gaul would kill the console proclaiming that he would indeed take the light for himself no 
matter the cost or impediment as we returned to our home the city's sky was Ablaze with gunfire 
and the Vanguard were under pressure by the time we reached them across the city rooftops they were 
all but spent we used the Vex teleporter that Kate had painstakingly set up and went forth to face 
Dominus GA we found him aboard his command ship and before the cage of the traveler itself as we 
approached an inferno of Dark Twisted light was ahead of us and light had been siphoned into 
containers All Along The Command Deck of the ship something terrible had happened in front 
of the cage of the tra treler itself we fought with Dominus GA and realized that Gaul had indeed 
harnessed the light and Infused himself with it temporarily but painfully gaining a twisted 
measure of the light's own power we faced a paracausal threat that day we fought Gul as an 
equal he was one of the most powerful cabal to ever exist a razor of a thousand worlds and an 
annihilator of suns before he had even claimed the light but now he had our own powers now he too had 
become Legend in a battle of light against light we proved the superior Force we struck down the 
Dominus in spite of his rage and his belief that the light should be his to wield but as his body 
fell the light erupted from it and Gul momentarily manifested in a Godlike towering form a luminous 
being standing before the traveler almost the same size as it he addressed The Traveler believing 
that he had indeed become a God he was mistaken as he proclaimed the dawning of a new age something 
awoke within the traveler power boundless and pure whether through our actions or as a response 
to a Divine challenge The Traveler had awoken it was alive once more it shattered the bonds 
of its cage casting off its shackles and it ulated the false god that stood before it in 
a blinding explosion of light that destroyed the foundations of the cage itself light erupted 
from The Traveler it shattered the cage freeing itself and proclaiming its return triumphant as 
Humanity's protector the light that emerged from The Traveler would spread across the whole of the 
cosmos starting at Earth and then spreading out over the planets of our solar system and beyond 
the light poured across the universe as far as it could reach the results of this moment would 
take time to emerge many worlds in Saul would be changed many great beings would react to this 
moment where the traveler had returned turned but worst of all in the darkness out between 
galaxies something else had begun to stir at the reaction of the Traveler's Reawakening a presence 
once lost to time banished from Soul at the end of the collapse was returning the black Fleet 
perceived the light the witness who had so long ago been cast out began the long slow march to 
towards Saul The Traveler was reawakened and now it would be able to have its final shape once more 
no matter the cost it would achieve its ultimate goal for the universe it was only a matter of time 
before the black Fleet would return for now in the aftermath of the red War seemingly there was 
peace yet again the the red Legion were cast out of the city but there were still many remnants 
out there in the Wilds but at very least the walls were secure our last Tower may have been destroyed 
but the Guardians once again were the Defenders of their city and with the Traveler's Reawakening 
and the destruction of the cage all the Guardians had their light back once again but the defeat 
of Dominus GA also prompted another actor at the edge of our system to make their move at last 
one day we received a strange invitation gilded and coverting cabal heraldry it was a letter it 
was a long letter an entire Treatise from someone known as Emperor callus the same deposed Emperor 
who had been removed from Power by his daughter Gaul and the Consul in the midnight coup he was 
inviting us to his Leviathan a vessel that would soon appear above nessus and he planned to reward 
us for defeating one of the foes that had deposed him an invitation from the former Emperor had the 
Vanguard notably concerned as did the following arrival of the huge World eating vessel itself 
as it began to consume nurus we made an action to board the Leviathan and began to fight through 
the many loyalists of callus eventually though we realized this was not some Grand Garrison this 
was more of a pleasure barge a Palace built in opulence for the purpose of entertainment 
eventually we would make our way through all of Call's games and found ourselves in a throne room 
there we did battle with the emperor of the cabal or at least we at first thought we did the more 
we battled with this Emperor the more he started to break down until it was eventually very clear 
that we weren't facing a real cabal emperor but instead a robotic double of himself a faximile 
designed to render his true self protected as we struck down the construct it told us to take the 
riches we had earned and to grow fat from strength he also told us of an impending cataclysm that 
loomed ahead of us a black Edge that he had seen at the Forefront of the universe's leading void a 
fate which we should all prepare for we had little time to think on Call's words but they would be 
representative of the Doom that was approaching Us in the form of the black Fleet but before we 
could even begin to prepare for them the wave of light sent out by The Traveler was Awakening 
terrible gods and ancient constructs across the system allall of Soul was about to change 
forever and it would start with the return of an old Mentor to ior Ray a fabled warlock lost 
deep within the infinite Forest on Mercury [Music] it had been barely a few months since the return 
of the traveler and already the system had gone through a vast series of changes but unseen to 
us on Mercury Osiris and his ghost sagira were also experiencing strange happenings in part they 
saw how it was affecting the Vex and our futures should they be the ones to build them one day 
as they explored the simulations of the infinite Forest Osiris saw into a future that filled him 
with Dread a future where the Vex had finally won this was when Osiris also was confronted by 
something else hopes the Vex mind responsible for discovering and creating the simulation where 
the Vex were victorious in a moment of desperation Osiris flung siga through a portal out of the 
infinite Forest she was damaged by stray Goblin slap rifle fire but her shell would be discovered 
by the Vanguard and was returned to the last City aora ordered us to make contact with the oyan 
culton Mercury and to attempt to explore the newly active Gateway into the infinite Forest we failed 
to enter it at first and saw many strange Vex from the future and past showing up indicating a huge 
influx of active units in the area the Assyrian cultist brother Vance would make a recommendation 
to us after we had saved him and those who resided in the lighthouse he knew that we would need to 
make contact with Osiris and that saving his ghost was probably one of the best ways to find out 
where he was some of the other cultists in the edz had the equipment required to reactivate 
sagira it was our only lead at the time so we followed it the cultists were unfortunately dead 
but we did find the equipment needed for sagira to temporarily indwell within our own ghosts shell 
and help us enter the infinite Forest it was there that we first met Osiris or rather his Echoes 
these were effectively perfect copies of Osiris made in a strange Shimmer of light he had always 
been able to summon them a strange Quirk of his own paracausal abilities based in an unknown 
teaching that only he seems to have mastered these Echoes led us through the forest and showed 
us how Mercury was corrupted by the Vex back at the turn of the golden age before leading us to 
the dark future where the Vex were victorious here we saw ponpes for the first time and had to 
quickly Escape its grasp which would be capable of superseding our Light Within the simulations of 
the infinite Forest Forest leaving the forest it was clear that we needed to destroy this construct 
over our investigations we learned that that would require us to locate a map of the infinite forest 
and to discover the original moment where pupes had been created within its simulations with 
this information in hand we would be able to track the Vex Mind through the many Pathways of 
the forest we fought through red Legion Invaders stuck in a Time Loop various Vex cons structs and 
a variety of other strange hazards all to acquire this information but eventually we found what 
we were looking for as we discovered the exact temporal coordinates for ponop it showed up right 
in front of us and abducted seira's Essence from our ghost's own shell we were promptly ejected 
from the infinite forest and could only return later with the aid of iora Ray who used her 
remarkable power to smash through the gateway's defenses and allow us Ingress we quickly converged 
on the coordinates that we had discovered along with Osiris's Echoes and Osiris himself bopes 
was destroyed by our combined might and sagira was released the threat of Vex Supremacy had been 
cut short after reuniting with his ghost and his student Osiris sought to return to the infinite 
forest with the aim of Defending us against to the Vex and further searching for Saint 14 we 
would return to the lighthouse and made use of its infinite Forge to craft several Implements 
of War none were more Curious than the perfect paradx the discovery of this weapon was linked to 
a signal within the infinite Forest that matched the signature of St 14's light converging on 
that point we discovered that it was indeed his light but he was no nowhere to be found as 
it turned out the Vex had created a singular Mind Over countless thousands of simulations 
that was designed specifically to drain his light we would follow the path of Saint and 
discovered what seemed to be a memorial to the great Titan he had slain thousands of Vex 
in his explorations of the forest and they had expended significant resources to defeat him on 
his body we discovered the broken remnants of this shotgun we reforged it in the lighthouse' 
infinite Forge but it led us to a moment where something seemingly impossible happened remarkably 
Saint 14 had left a message for us with this weapon stating that he remembered the moment when 
we gave it to him we had only ever been raised as a guardian within the last half of a decade St 14 
received this weapon in the early City age or late Dark Age perhaps regardless we weren't alive for 
that moment so it seemed impossible that we would have been able to give him this weapon regardless 
we held on to this weapon understanding that Not only was it one of the finer crafted shotguns 
that we had received at the time but also that with time travel and the Vex certain possibilities 
may arise even if they are technically impossible this perfect Paradox might yet come to pass 
we might yet live to see ourselves present St 14 with this shotgun we all mourned the 
loss of this great hero but we would not have long to do so soon we would need to descend 
upon Mars and face a rising new threat the Traveler's light had awakened slumbering gods 
and began to Thor the ice around helis Basin soon Mars would become a battleground of old 
machines and ancient Shadows once more [Music] what happened next began with an unusual amount 
of warsats falling in helis Basin Mars was known to be the home to many of the war mines 
systems but this activity was unusually focused the red legion's propensity to scavenge 
such valuable technology meant that we quickly had to investigate the region we were greeted 
with a transmission from another resurfacing Legend Anastasia Bray the long lost Guardian 
the infamous Hunter of Twilight Gap she had converged on this location in her quest for the 
core of the warind Rasputin whilst we'd interfaced with Trace segments of him before this was his 
true core and the Heart of his system and she'd found it just in the neck of time we arrived as 
the ice was beginning to Thor and as the forces of zul and nocis were beginning to return from 
their long Slumber Commander Zavala was quick to assert himself into the picture given that 
he saw the war mind as an imminent threat to humanity if it wasn't capable of being made into 
an asset anab was n't so convinced and believed that Rasputin could be an ally of his own valtion 
something that Rasputin quickly pounced upon the opportunity to prove by deploying weapons for us 
to use against The Hive in particular a javelin filled with warmed energy known as the valkyrie 
for the time being Zavala was still unconvinced and so he continued to take command focusing his 
efforts on drawing out the newly Rising threat on Mars the world worm God zal we would need 
to kill zul of course and Zavala thought that we would be up to the task after all we had 
defeated the taken King we had killed gods of the hive before surely this time it wouldn't 
be so different in order to do this we would need to lure all out and so we converged on the 
European Dead Zone to steal a small Shard of the traveler a source of strong light which would be 
enough to tempt zal's hunger and bait the Trap but the Trap would not be on our own terms we 
would need to descend deep into the Martian tunnels in order to lur out Z there we would face 
ncis's brood for the first time and saw firsthand the power of Hive necromancy used against us in 
order to summon back numerous dead Hive into the battle as it was going on fighting through them 
we eventually reached a massive ritual chamber and faced off against nocis for the first time he 
was defeated but he escaped his death thanks to zul holding possession of his heart not unlike an 
ascendant plain although not in keeping with the logic of the sword as we placed our bait here in 
the center of the Broods hold we tried to lure us all out and the worm did make an appearance but 
even here with all our light the worm's power and darkness was overwhelming quickly after it 
addressed Us only for most moments we realized it was going to be too strong we were buried in 
the snowy drifts beneath the Martian surface our ghost was luckily able to fish us out but the 
situation was beginning to evolve in a rather dramatic fashion Z was now making a beine for 
Rasputin and our plan had completely Fallen apart Zavala caved and admitted that perhaps we would 
need the war mine's assistance and its Valkyrie weapons to actually defeat the worm God just as 
anab had continuously pointed out as we closed on Rasputin's core we overloaded some of his systems 
in order to overcharge the valkyrie with yet more power an unfortunate but necessary step for what 
we were about to do despite Z's gargantuan size and his great power with our might and the 
war min's Weaponry combined we were able to overcome this great beast and saw it destroyed 
in the shadow of the war mind in the aftermath of the battle Rasputin made contact with us 
telling us that he would be the guardian of the system of soul and of humanity as he had once 
been and that he would have no equal in this moment he began to launch an entirely new series 
of warsats into the system and expanded his reach and sight to all new avenues and all new heights 
our further explorations of Mars would lead us to ReDiscover some of the eolos weapon project and 
in in particular updated designs for the sleeper simulant that Rasputin had initially created for 
Guardians during the taken war against orx we also found our first hints as to the true identity of 
the EXO stranger after decoding several messages and sigils left behind we discovered that 
the EXO stranger was likely to be none other than Anna Bray's own sister Elsie Elsie's final 
message was simply asking us to watch over Anna and to ask us to be ready knowing that soon we 
would meet again there was also one mysterious circumstance Whispers on iO that Drew us to the 
Lost Oasis beneath in dark catacombs we would hear the words of zul again even though he had 
perished at our hands and from these Whispers a challenge was rendered down here in the dark upon 
completing this Challenge and proving our might within the hive's own logic we would discover 
the whisper of the worm the last remnants of Z's hungry Soul clefted into a weapon and made 
manifest in our hands zul would bind himself to the logic of the sword and to us so that 
he could not only survive but feed greedily upon the killing blows that we dealt to our 
foes and there would be many foes awaiting us in the future far greater challenge has awaited 
us on the horizon and it would all begin in the reef as the conflict on Mars began to die down 
cage and the Queen's wroth pet renge had gone hunting a new Abomination had hit the reef in 
recent months arriving mass of new elix forces that were not quite alive these new dead elix 
or rather Undead elix were known as the scorn tainted by some kind of dark ether they could be 
risen again from the dead repeatedly they were led by eight Barons whom the Hunter and the Queen's 
WTH would work capture successfully over a long campaign in the process of this they discovered 
that the true leader of the scorn was an all to familiar face a traitor Aldren sa brother of the 
late Queen Mara for their crimes all of the scorn and uldren were locked away in the max security 
wing of the prison of Elders as one of the Barons foll The Fanatic spoke to varx the loyal he made 
it clear that the awoken lacked a strong leader without Mara varx saw this and feared for the 
fate of his own people as well it was the words of Aldren that may well have pushed him over the 
edge and made it feel as though it was necessary for him to perform his next treacherous action 
varx made off with his own personal ether supplies and released every prisoner within the prison 
of Elders in order to cover his Escape as this happened many terrible criminals were released 
such as Aramis the ship stealer Baron of the House of devils but of course most crucially of all the 
scorn was set Loose as well Petra recalled Cade immediately to help her contain the prison break 
and Cade invited us along for the ride and thanks to Cade's assistance we were able to truly lock 
down the prison once and for all but Petra had a deeper concern she headed down to the supermax 
Wing where the Barons and Aldren were being locked away and she found that they had all made their 
escape they were leaving via the airlock on the lowest part of the prison of Elders Cade destroyed 
a part of the prison's central processing Hub and rode the debris down to reach them more quickly 
unfortunately this left him isolated and alone and destroyed some of our ways down that we might 
have used to get to him more quickly alone he faced off against the majority of the escaped 
scorn they were armed and ready for this moment and whilst it was not the falling clubs and 
nashing Teeth of the scorn foot soldiers that got to him there was one amongst their number 
who was better armed a baron HHA The Rifleman he would take up a perge above the battlefield 
and waited for an ideal moment to strike but he didn't kill Cade he killed Cade's ghost Sundance 
Cade was left broken and beaten by his encounter with the Barons without the light there was 
little hope but it was Prince Aldren who stole Cade's weapon the Ace of Spades and asked 
him if he had any last words moments before we could arrive at the scene alren delivered 
the killing blow fatally shooting Cade 6 as we arrived Aldren and the Barons escaped and Cade 
passed away in our arms we would return Cade's remains to the Tower and those zala didn't want to 
commit forces to hunting Aldren for fear of losing more friends aora had a fire in her heart so did 
we we stated plainly for Zavala that he wouldn't need to commit any forces breaking the silence 
that had persisted since the black Garden's heart for the first time we spoke and promised alren 
s would die by our hands but before going after Aldren s aora had found something that we needed 
to address she had been having visions and dreams of light potentially sent to her by The Traveler 
we followed those dreams to IO and were gifted with new understandings of our light with these 
new powers in hands it appeared that the traveler might be preparing to arm us better for what came 
next to hunt down the Barons we would need to head to the Tangled Shore a lawless and Wayward patch 
of space within the Reef's territory frequented by Pirates and Smugglers Petra picked up on our 
signal shortly after we arrived and offered us some assistance against the Barons that assistance 
came in an unusual form elix criminal elix but elix at our side nonetheless this was perhaps the 
first time we had properly fought alongside Allied Fallen it turned out that these elix didn't work 
for Petra but instead worked for the spider an elix Crime Boss who had grown frustrated but the 
Barons were cutting into his business on the shore having even removed him from his previous Hideout 
he agreed to give us their location in exchange for us running a few errands for him on the shore 
when he did go up the location of the Barons they had had the necessary time to fortify it into 
a stronghold of their own and though we carved through numerous scorn we arrived too late the 
Barons escaped and we had to individually hunt them down before reaching Aldren s and so we 
went down and hunted them all the rider the mad bomber the trickster The Rifleman the hangman 
the Mindbender The Machinist and eventually as we made our way to a well-guarded awoken Watchtower 
we faced down the last of them ficoll the ftic but while we had been hunting Aldren had been 
listening as it turned out his murder of Cade had not been of his own valtion entirely he had been 
guided to his Target by a spectral vision of his lost sister Mara who had told him to let the reef 
burn and that only he could free her from some dark prison the spectral Vision guided him to the 
European Dead Zone where he took a Shard of the traveler and brought it with him to the Tangled 
Shores Watchtower deep within that Watchtower the one that l L to the dreaming City the corruption 
behind aldrin's eyes was starting to grow in that moment the darkness with an Aldren and the shards 
light were combined they opened a Gateway within the inner Chamber Of The Watchtower a Gateway 
that led to the dreaming City The Apparition of Mara thanked alren and said that he had indeed 
been the key to freeing her but in truth alrin had Unleashed a powerful taken entity a chimera 
possessed of a greater mind somewhere off far beyond the Portal's end it quickly consumed him 
swallowing him whole just as we arrived on the scene we had to destroy this terrible monster 
and after defeating it a broken beaten and no longer Bewitched Aldren was lying face first in 
front of us just as he had done to Cade we then offered him his last words with the Ace of Spades 
being held in dark offering of finality it isn't clear to this day who killed The Forsaken Prince 
but his death would create Echoes across the many years of our story still to come Petra wasn't done 
though regardless of whether we had shot Aldren or whether she had she insisted that the work needed 
to continue and it would continue in the dreaming City she told us that we needed to make contact 
with marov and that she could do so if we merely returned to the Watchtower and stepped through the 
Gateway that Aldren had created on the other side we got our first Glimpse at the dreaming City the 
awoken most sacred place in all existence we met up with Petra and after reactivating an awoken 
device called The Oracle engine we heard the voice of maras sov but unlike for poor Aldren 
this was no Apparition this time the voice of the queen was real and as it turned out Aris 
Mara and Osiris's plans had borne fruit back at the Battle of Saturn the queen knew that she 
would need to die and that her death would leave orx exposed but she had prepared for this moment 
much like the hive she had carved a throne world for herself out of the ascendant plain with the 
assistance of her captured wish Dragon Riven she was able to create elinia a throne of her own 
that would allow her to persist Beyond Death but unfortunately the dreaming City had been left 
vulnerable to an attack by orex in the opening moments of the taken war and so orx had reached 
through and corrupted Mara's Throne world and had even sent his agents into the dreaming City it 
was now infested not just with scorn but also with taken and worse still Hive Broods were descending 
upon the awoken Most Holy stronghold but worst of all Riven had been taken by orex before we had 
destroyed him she had been the one who had been directing Aldren she had been the one who had 
given him the visions of Mara she had been the one responsible for Cade's death Petra had put 
two and two together quickly enough and Mara did as well Aldren might have pulled the trigger but 
the real Menace behind this was the manipulations of Riven of a thousand voices the last known 
aamar the vengeance of a monarch who has lived for a million years is something to behold and the 
action which Mara undertook was Swift and decisive without hesitation she decreed that the dreaming 
City should be opened to the Guardians and that we should assemble a team to hunt the last yamara we 
were promised the Bounty of the awoken Realms yet again if we could slay Riven and so we eagerly set 
out on our mission as we worked our way towards the Queen's walk Spire we could not have known the 
Doom that we would unleash but as our feet touched the ground our hearts were set on Vengeance and 
so perhaps it was already too late we began our missions by freeing the teans CI and shiroi 
who instructed us that they would be able to contain riven's heart if only we killed her they 
also warned against the strong desires that we brought to bear in our fight telling us that our 
desires as six Immortal Gods Slayers could feed a nation of alhamar let alone just one but maybe 
we should have listened more closely moving deeper into the heart of the dreaming City we faced 
challenges from powerful taken and some of the awoken defenses that sealed Riven away and when 
at last we reached the Spire itself we confronted Riven in her Titanic form she had been empowered 
with the darkness of the taken energy thanks to orx and her already significant power and strength 
as a dragon was nearly unmatched racing up and down the Spire we fought with her The Last Dragon 
the last aamar until at last the killing blow was struck and there was nothing more that Riven 
could do but Grant One Last Wish when we took her heart to the teans they contained it away but 
Riven Sirens still spoke to us and revealed that we had unwittingly given her the power to Grant 
the wish of another dark entity as Immortal Gods Slayers our will and desire was indeed a banquet 
for Riven just as the teans had warned and with our wish to kill her granted she fed gluttonously 
on that power she used it to enact the Whimsical wish of another being who had visited her in her 
time of isolation between the death of orx and our arrival in the dreaming City another mysterious 
presence had crept in one whose name we would know in fear from this day forward savathun the 
witch Queen she had also made a wish of Riven of a thousand voices but this time it was not one 
which Riven could so easily twist or so easily Grant without the requisite power savathun's wish 
the Last Wish Riven granted here in this moment was that the dreaming City should be taken and so 
with our power having been delivered unto rivens hungry Jaws it was so the dreaming city was 
cursed to exist in a terrible limbo every 3 weeks a cycle would continue the curse would grow 
in potency week by week until it crescendoed in that third and final week and then the cycle would 
begin again those trapped within the weft of the dreaming City's curse abound still to this day 
they will repeat the same 3 weeks M over and over perhaps for all eternity until the universe has 
gutted out and there is nothing left but entropy there is little that can be done to save them none 
can leave none can flee they are trapped they can only live out their Eternal Fates forever more 
riven's final Vengeance against the awoken would not be the destruction of the dreaming City that 
she had helped to build it would not be the death of Aldrin at the hands of those was looking to 
avenge Cade it would instead be the cursing of the awoken people and their most sacred Place Riven 
had laid a trap like this for a long time and now in this darkest moment riven's Vengeance was 
complete but as the curse cycle continued onward and the forces of the tower attempted to learn 
more about what exactly had caused it there was an unexpected spark of light in this dark place 
a ghost named glint entered the dreaming City it had been doing what all ghosts do it was searching 
for a guardian his Guardian it found an abandoned Monument on a distant Cliff there under a funeral 
poll a body had been laid to rest scanning the body glint determined that it was one worthy of 
wielding the Traveler's light this was the one this was his Guardian but the man glint raised 
had once been known as ultr and S as a guardian freshly reborn this former Prince of the reef had 
no memories of his past life no recollection of the people he had killed or the pain that he had 
caused he was a new person his past life was not his to live soon enough he would find his former 
identity his past self and would discover the truth but until then he did have to choose a new 
name and so he would be known as the new person that he was no longer as Olden s The Forsaken 
Prince but as the crow a lightbearer [Music] in the aftermath of riven's defeat an age of 
lawlessness descended upon the tower Guardians had shown their open resentment towards the 
Vanguard for refusing to send a full force to go after Aldren s the fact that a rogue Guardian had 
achieved the version of Justice most people wanted to see by taking things into their own hands only 
soured this wound further it there was a time when we saw the authority of the tower loosen to the 
point where we began forging strange alliances with many new faces of particular note would be 
801 of the black Armory the former emperor of the cabal callus and a mysterious man with no name who 
would ask that we simply called him The Drifter our first real meeting was with ad1 and she very 
quickly made it clear that she was not exactly fond of Guardians she ran what was left of the 
black Armory an institution that had been started back before the collapse which adaah had preserved 
in her Time Master weapons Crafters with some of the most powerful technology preserved from the 
Golden Age and improved over time she had seen the assaults of the Warlords in the Dark Ages and 
had even seen the black Armory suffer under those assaults the Warlords had sought the remarkable 
weapons technology of The Foundry technology that ada1 had managed to preserve but now she needed 
assistance her forges were either lost or overrun and the potent arms of the black Armory had drawn 
wondering eyes so wearily at the advice of the spider she extended her hand in cooperation to us 
against all of her best instincts whilst we would reclaim the forges from a number of assailants 
none would be more persistent than Civics the leader of a new group of Fallen known as the Kel's 
Scourge he was a ruthless opponent who would first be known to us for his most daring Gambit a raid 
upon a black Armory Vault located within the last City itself given the elix propensity for taking 
technology and splicing it together with their own they quickly used whatever they found within 
the Vault to great effect they augmented the armor weapons and shields of their soldiers worse 
still they began to in rench their position and even constructed the first iteration of a war 
machine that would go onto Mar the system for years to come they created Insurrection Prime the 
first ever pattern of Fallen brick Guardians had to clear out the force of Fallen Raiders from the 
last City's B District especially given the fact that the Invaders had discovered super weapons 
capable of bringing Devastation to the city at large this was a desperate Gambit by the Fallen 
but it was an equally desperate defense by us Guardians luckily we were able to fend off the 
Kel's Scourge even after Insurrection Prime fell though it was clear that what was left of the 
black Armory stalks within the Vault had been taken Civic was nowhere to be found and there 
would be a trail of discarded and torn papers from the black armory's files we had discovered 
that his rumaging would lead us to other forges in particular notes had been found that would 
lead Civics on a trail to to the European Dead Zone to the Lost fourth Forge of the black Armory 
at their old edz facility this also contained a project that was unique to the black Armory at 
the very end of the Golden Age a project that was being created in the soall naobi labs project 
naobi itself would be an attempt to combine a forge with a working exom mind from Clovis Bray 
an EXO body as it turned out 01 was the Prototype after breaking through layers of security and 
finally facing off against the Kel Scourge one last time we discovered a critical component that 
Civic had retrieved a1's lost obsidian accelerator returning it to ada1 returning the black Armory 
papers and returning her forges to working order meant that she would at least be able to trust the 
Guardians seeing that despite the actions of the Warlords we were not all Cut From the Same Cloth 
we earned her trust that day and in the process earned ourselves some of the most powerful and 
Infamous weapons that have ever been wielded by Guardians the great izanagi's burden in particular 
was a weapon that still stands the test of time to this day much like so many others it has slain 
gods in our hands The Drifter was the next face to darken our door although by this point we 
had already engaged with him several times particularly in his so-called Gambit an arena 
that pitted Guardians against Guardians in race to manipulate darker powers and claim victory over 
the taken rumors and mystery had swirled around The Drifter for years he had had dealings with the 
Dark Guardians known as the shadows of yore he had supposedly lived in the days of the iron Lords 
and had made petitions of felwinter himself he had visited the so-called fourth tomb of nzar and 
lived to tell the tale he had been to a dark world and seen umbrell Monsters devour his crew's light 
regardless of which of these rumors were true or not it was clear that this lightbearer 
was dangerous our involvement with him deepened when we made our way into his ship and 
communed with the suppliers that would allow him to harness the taken as it turned out these 
suppliers were the nine our interactions with them prior to this point had been very limited 
only the creature sir who we'd seen occasionally in the tower had communicated with us and of 
course there had been our brief contact with the Emissary who had invited us into trials in 
the past trials specifically set forth by the nine to see us in combat this Emissary communed 
with us once more she was mostly unknown to us merely as just The Nine's mouthpiece but they 
explained the nature of many beings as we interacted with them throughout the system they 
also gave us the first true hints that there was some amongst our ranks that would begin to 
wield the powers of darkness and that such Darkness would represent an elemental balance of 
sorts they had seen that Elsie Bray and Eris mour would go on to wield the darkness and they saw 
that all Fates would Converge on us they also saw that The Drifter was beginning to wield Darkness 
as well in possibly the least surprising turn of Fate they didn't explicitly hint that we would 
be doing the same but the possibility was left open from the nine we learned that the Drifter had 
indeed been one of the so-called Shadows of yore and had once gone by the moniker of dredge and 
hope after the nine had seen his capacity to wield Darkness without corruption they had gifted him 
the hall the massive orb at the tail end of his vessel an engine of potential and the source of 
his taken when connected to the Realms of the nine as we communed more with them we would continue to 
re-enter the hall which reshaped itself every time when we did we discovered more of their secrets 
eventually culminating in the Revelation that The Drifter was aware of an impending doom and that 
he was preparing to survive a second collapse of sorts the nine had warned him of this incoming 
threat and had told him to keep playing the game of Gambit leaving him with one of his signature 
Jade coins this time not embossed with the Sigil of a familiar enemy but instead with a vessel 
of the black Fleet yet another warning that they would soon be upon us the drifter's mystery was 
a curiosity to us all but it was also a potential threat to the general safety of the tower in the 
eyes of others there were some who believed that The Drifter represented a greater existential 
threat than even figures such as orx but he was not simply a representation of fear and darkness 
he was a representation of Po potential Temptation and corruption in particular there were Guardians 
that given the choice would have seen Drifter killed amongst their ranks was a member of the 
praic order known as aror Mahal a hidden agent she would take time to investigate The Drifter 
and find out whether he was working for good or not in the end arnor chose not to strike him 
down even though she easily could have given the chance he gave her her valid information 
on the whereabouts of some loose Shadow of Your Pretenders and with this she was satisfied 
that The Drifter could at least be trusted to discern who was too dangerous to be allowed to 
thrive The Drifter was safe for now though it would still be correct to say that the Vanguard 
tolerated his presence rather than welcoming him in this time we also made contact with another 
mysterious figure an elix Captain called mithrax we had met him before on Titan where he had 
continuously given us the slip in a battle for a methane reactor at the station's core we 
spared his life in a moment of Mercy when fighting against a hive Knight this gesture of Mercy that 
he had capitalized on was something that had utterly changed him after dwelling on it for some 
time mithrax had decided on a course of action that would Mark him as a unique member of the 
elix one with determination and grit and above all Faith he believed that he could be the Kell of a 
new house of Alix one that stood in allegiance to the Guardians and stood for the will of the great 
machine he named it the house of light but his fledgling house would need time to grow and in the 
meantime he needed to show his loyalty and so it was that through a convoluted list of messages and 
alerts he was able to bring us to the farm where he then told us of another invasion of the last 
city that would occur soon not an allout invasion and an attempt to rob a larger Vault of the black 
Armory this time no instead it would be a more covert operation conducted by a fallen Baron who 
had escaped the prison of Elders Aramis the ship stealer she was planning still an audacious Heist 
a raid on the old tow deeper vaults that were held by the cryptar if she succeeded she would make off 
with the remnants of outbreak Prime the sea weapon that had first emerged during the ca crisis 
mithrax offered us Aid and became the first notable example of cooperation between the elix 
and Humanity that wasn't explicitly made under pirate schemes as we succeeded it would also 
be the decisive moment that would drive Aramis closer to the side of Darkness she would curse 
mithrax and the great machine and she would seek power elsewhere the old dogma of the elix was not 
enough she would seek a par causal Boon she would seek Darkness later that same year we would leave 
behind elix activity the drifter's games and a1's forges so that we could return to a place of 
opulence that had been pulled into squala the emperor Callis had called us back to the Leviathan 
we had already made several return Journeys at the behest of the emperor The Vessel had been 
dealing with various issues over the last year at one point it had consumed ness's planetary core 
and at another point the last flailing leader of the red Legion Valor had invaded its upper Spire 
in an attempt to rest control of the vessel this time callus had made a grave miscalculation of an 
entirely different nature he was looking to expand his armies and to gain control over the hive he 
believed that he had to gain control over them in order to prepare the universe for the ending 
that he had foreseen and which he imagined when he first beheld the witness and so he went to one 
of the cabal's AUM worlds and retrieved a hive artifact of remarkable power the crown of Sorrow 
the wearer of this Hive Crown could supposedly gain a remarkable degree of control over the 
hive and thus could be their leader Dallas wasn't foolish enough to wear the crown himself but he 
did create a Genetically Enhanced Warrior to wear it the Warrior's name was galran and he had been 
enhanced with a series of more resilient mental barriers and protections in an attempt to resist 
the corruption of the crown but the true power within this Crown was wielded by one who was more 
deadly than we could possibly have anticipated Crown's true master was savathun realistically 
there was very little that could have been done to protect galran from such corruption when he wore 
the crown almost instantly savathun took control of of him and the Lawless Hive that had filled 
the lower decks of the Leviathan as nothing more than fodder or perhaps an entertaining Amusement 
for callus suddenly turned into an organized Force this area of the Menagerie was known to house 
many exotic beasts and in the process some of the Vex that callus had stored here were released 
as well but as the hive were the more pressing threat we were asked to deal with them and were 
dispatched to deal with galran first caras called Upon Us promising us Untold riches should we 
succeed and succeed we did these actions would be so impressive to him that he would begin to see 
our place within his ranks evolve into something more in time he would offer us a place amongst his 
Shadows his secret agents that served as assassins and loyal protectors the same agents that had gone 
after the conspirators same agents that had tried continually to kill his daughter GA and the conso 
some Guardians might have accepted the title for a time we might have as well but the emperor's sway 
would be held more strongly over some Guardians than others callus lavished us all with gifts 
including donating a tribute Hall of sorts to us one that could be used to Mark our various 
achievements this tribute Hall was fascinating for it was haunted by an all too familiar Spirit 
toand the shattered we had interacted with his incorporeal Spirit countless times by now we first 
saw him on the dreadn as he guided us towards orx the taken King and we had met him again in the 
dreaming city as he helped us to navigate the ascendant Realms now we met him here and followed 
his teachings to reforge a weapon of Staggering power the bad ju guu the hungry engine of the 
sword logic that tolent himself had conceived of a weapon whose hunger was seemingly ending and whose 
purpose was to consume till the universe was made sharp toand used this opportunity to warn us after 
we had acquired the weapon that there were greater forces of Darkness that we had yet to face forces 
that were higher on the rungs of the pyramid than even those Hive gods that we had slain thus far 
and that those forces would arrive sooner than we expected his words could not have been more 
prophetic considering what happened next [Music] ever since the invasion of the last City during 
the red War we had not actually seen or heard from Maris MN she had been in Communications with 
marov and had made several excursions with her in an attempt to better understand the foe that was 
approaching Fate has a funny way of being cyclical and Aris would find herself returning to the place 
where she had been changed forever she returned to Luna hot on the trail of this new Shadow a looming 
nightmare that we would soon have to confront our first realization of this looming threat came in 
the sudden Resurgence of Hive activity on the moon having now crushed croa orx zul and nocis the 
renewed forces of the last City descended upon the moon with confidence we had slain great 
gods of the hive and the great disaster was a distant memory little did we know that the 
tragedy of that nightmarish past would soon quite literally come to revisit us we made our 
way in the initial assault towards the new great Fortress of the hive that had been risen from 
the moon's surface and we then delved deeper into the pits below our ghost could make out strange 
readings as we faced The Hive and it turned out that they weren't truly Hive they looked like 
them they had the same bioenergetics as them but they were like Shadows or Whispers faximile 
foes that we had known well and yet they were not those foes something wasn't right we soon started 
to see visions of strange ghostly figures before us they looked like Guardians Shadows tinted in 
a bloody and terrible Hue something something was not right that much was clear but we could not 
have guessed at the true extent of what we were about to face the oppressive Darkness enveloped 
us as we moved through a canyon that led into a great crass our ghosts started to say that 
they were feeling strange and then we saw it the Pyramid of Luna a vessel of the black Fleet 
the same vessel that had once belonged to nzar the final God of pain the vessel that had been 
sent crashing into the moon during the collapse and yet here it was the vessel that had led the 
assault on Earth it was unblemished untarnished and it appeared to have just awoken as we 
continued our approach we were blocked by a defensive barrier of the pyramids a force 
field that slowed our movements and prevented our passage but these weren't the only defenses 
that nzar pyramid had in place in response to our attempted and unwelcome intrusion the 
pyramid began to manifest remnants of some of our greatest fears a nightmare swollen with 
malice began to take shape in front of us and we saw green fire and a terribly familiar blade what 
appeared before us was croa the son of orex but this was impossible he was striding forth once 
more across the Moon that he had ravaged and yet he had died by our hand though it was clearly 
some false copy of the hive God that we had once known we cut him down and extracted a strange and 
nightmarish Essence but as soon as the light eater had fallen he rose again flanked by nightmares of 
Gaul and ficoll The Fanatic some of our greatest foes manifested once more as nightmares sent to 
destroy us this response from the pyramid would have overwhelmed us but Eris mour was there to 
assist us she pulled us out with the same Hive Magics that she had used long ago to save us 
in cota's Throne world she extracted us to an Overlook that showed the pyramid in its full Glory 
Aris told us that in order to understand what lay before us this ancient enemy that had caused our 
collapse we would need to find a way inside doing this would be no small task to bypass the defenses 
of the pyramid that we had encountered we would need to understand them after a little observation 
of the local Hive we discovered that they were unaffected by the nightmares this immunity would 
be our key to bypassing the defenses and whilst it was a relevant Revelation there was a more 
important one that happened swiftly after our investigation had started a nightmare of omigle 
passed through the camp it would have destroyed Eris mour were it not for the essence that we 
had claimed from the false nightmare of croa it turned out that this Essence that we had collected 
earlier was enough to defend arys and this was our next clue a lucky moment a lucky break but it 
would tell us that we could indeed collect and purify the Essences of the nightmares and could 
then transfer their power into special tokens a set of armor that would Ward us against the 
pyramid this was known as The Dream Bane armor and to complete it we would need to further 
refine our understandings of the hive's own protection against the nightmares we ventured to 
the apex of the Scarlet keep and slew cota's first daughter hush Ladon on her person she had a tablet 
speaking of something strange an object known as a cryptoglyph a hive artifact whose powerful runes 
could be used to cast their most potent spells after a little more investigation we discovered 
that retrieving it would allow us to finally Forge dream Bane armor we would finally be able to make 
use of any nightmare Essences that we had gathered including the ones of omigle and croa that we 
had previously slain but unfortunately accessing the cryptoglyph would be no small task we would 
need to find it by venturing to the lowest point at the bottom of the hellmouth deep within its 
catacombs we would find ourselves in a cavern that left us in the shadow of the pyramid itself 
the darkness in this place was so oppressive that our light was like the last flickering of a 
distant dying Sun but still we pushed forward we destroyed a second daughter of croa borith and 
narrowly escaped with the cryptoglyph in hand the darkness was so oppressive this time that arys 
could not pull us out we had to save ourselves after taking further Essences from the nightmares 
of tanx skolas and Fogo we were able to combine them with the earlier Essences of croa and omal 
and thus our Dream Bane armor was complete we had our defense against the pyramid barrier 
we ventured deeper toward the pyramid and as we fell further down the cliffs we realized that 
we were able to pass by the barrier but our ghost still kept speaking in a strange manner it was as 
though it was suffering and as though it wasn't itself as we made our way further down we jumped 
to reach the next section of cliff and were suddenly ens snared by a strange gravitational 
power it began to pull us slowly through the air towards an opening in the pyramid itself and 
our possessed ghost sounded as though he was now drained of light a new voice echoed through our 
ghost now it promised us violence Beauty and truth it stated that all of these things waited within 
the pyramid and that there was no turning back now it welcomed us into the Heart of Darkness itself 
after facing more terrible nightmares of Gaul The Fanatic and croa we reached the apex of the 
pyramid and saw the first of many veiled statues the meaning of these statues is still not known to 
this day but in great areas and concentrations of Darkness they can almost universally be found 
from Above This statue a strange orb floated down as we approached the artifact lay before 
us beckoning us and we reached out to touch it and for a moment there was darkness and then we 
were back in the black garden the sky was filled with dozens of vessels of the black Fleet and a 
dark copy of ourselves approached it promised us that soon they would arrive and that it was not 
our friend or our enemy but that instead it was our Salvation it is still not entirely clear but 
to this day it is believed that this is our first known contact and communication with the entity 
that we would come to know as the witness the perpetrator of the collapse the leader of the 
black Fleet the imort mortal and eternal enemy of the traveler when we extracted from the pyramid 
we quickly gave the artifact to arys for study it was unlike anything we had seen and was strangely 
unlike anything else that we had seen inside the pyramid it radiated strange signals and pulsed 
with an unfamiliar sickly light those signals began to pinpoint directions to us the artifact 
resonated with a new signal whose origin point would send us back to the first place where we had 
truly conquered darkness in any form it would send us back to the black garden using a Vex gate 
that we had discovered on the moon we ventured into that primordial place where the Vex of the 
Soul divisive still fought to bind themselves to a greater Divinity a power beyond their own 
understandings using the same techniques that they had before these vs had somewhat successfully 
bound themselves into this p power and they had achieved a form of apotheosis for themselves as 
we followed the signal deeper we moved towards its source at first we had always assumed that 
this was a great Mesa a great Stone structure that lay at the heart of the black garden upon 
further inspection we saw that it was in fact the remnants of a great tree though there were no 
branches and no trunk only a burnt and w withered stump Eris would later discover that this burnt 
stump was the remains of a tree of Silver Wings who destroyed it and why is a matter of great 
debate but at the Apex of what was left of this stump beneath a lake of radiolarian Vex fluid 
we discovered that at the heart of the tree there was another veiled statue and it was here 
that the artifact's signal concluded and when we returned having chased this signal all the 
way through the garden it began to change again Aris informed us that after this discovery the 
artifact had communicated further though these communications were not Visions they were messages 
of a more complex nature they were messages that seemed as though they came from a different 
Creator it is through these messages that we learned of the initial idea of a creation myth of 
the gardener and the win and how the balance of existence Before Time was undone by The Gardener's 
choices what part of this might be lies and what part of it might be truth is still unclear but 
what does seem clear is that whoever wrote it is not the same as the one who made contact with 
us in the garden through the artifact initially one speaks stating we will arrive and the other 
states I am Majestic there are many Mysteries to these communications from the artifact some we may 
understand should we venture Into the Heart of the traveler the artifact wasn't the only thing that 
sprung to life the Vex of the Soul divisive were emboldened by the recent events and they had begun 
to flood the moon from the garden channels they took the opportunity to resurrect the undying mind 
which fled into many different timelines across the garden and made copies of itself so that it 
would be guaranteed to succeed in its Mission and it could not be allowed to accomplish its purpose 
and return the heart of the black garden to life lest the whole of the light and creation should 
be destroyed for good facing this threat headon would be iora Ray's task she worked to construct 
a device that would be able to pull the copies of the undying mind from every timeline and would 
allow us to destroy it for good and with its destruction Guardians would change the course of 
history irrevocably and would hasten the march of all things to come with the destruction of the 
undying mind looming Shadows would encroach upon us once more they would arrive sooner than we 
could have realized but in opposition to these forces old Legends would also rise and even time 
itself would not stop them from returning to us in our greatest hour of need it was clear in 
this time that we were marshalling for war two sides of an eternal conflict were starting 
to square up and we needed reinforcements the first of which would come from a place that spoke 
of paradoxes and to the corridors of time [Music] itself after the destruction of the final copy of 
the undying mind Osiris noticed a distinct change in the infinite forest all future Vex simulations 
began pointing to a single distinct future possibility Osiris would explore this new world 
that repeated through every simulation and saw that it led to the destruction of the last City 
and to a monolithic structure looming over it in Victory he communicated this to iora and was 
aware that a terrible threat would soon be upon them but prior to this Osiris had also o been busy 
on Mercury trying to investigate other things he had constructed a device called the Sun Dial and 
it was a remarkable machine it allowed him to tap into the corridors of time the passageways used 
by the Vex to time travel but they could be used by US to do the same with the correct temporal 
coordinates osaris knew what he wanted to do he wished to influence things to change one specific 
moment in the timeline to make sure that his greatest error would not haunt him any longer he 
would try to bring back his long lost love Saint 14 sa 14's death was his greatest regret and 
as he first ventured into the seemingly endless corridors of time he sent out his echoes in their 
multitudes scouting as far as he could but no matter how far he went he could not find Saint 
not in the right moment where he could intercede and save him after a long time of trying he left 
his sun dial deactivated on Mercury and returned to his other business but it was here that another 
Force sought to make use of it after their defeat the red Legion was still looking for technology 
and advantage in this system and in particular their leadership at the time had fallen to a small 
group of Scion flares they discovered the Sundial and saw that it sung with the potential to change 
the course of history and so they decided to make use of it for themselves dividing their efforts 
into the past present and future with one of each of their senior Trio pushing to control fate in 
each and change the course of history so that the red Legion had never lost the red war and so it 
was that three of the senior flers niru tazaroc and Ole all ventured forth leaving their youngest 
sister amtech behind as she was not ready to take on such a burden realizing his error Osiris 
quickly recalled the Guardians and asked us to use the Sundial to venture into these different 
contained timelines so that we would be able to destroy the flares within each one this would 
stop them from enacting their plan and rewriting the course of history for their own benefit we 
would face countless copies of these three cion flares and in each timeline we would bring them to 
heal destroying them for good but the sual was not originally made with the purpose of chasing the 
Scions Osiris had originally made it to recover Saint 14 and when we brought the perfect Paradox 
Saints shotgun into proximity with the Sundial the two reacted perfect Paradox managed to 
transmit a pair of temporal coordinates to us Osiris would previously have blundered blindly 
into the corridors of time but now following these coordinates we were able to follow the corridors 
for ourselves and in doing so we would find Saint following the first set of coordinates we 
ventured into the corridors and found ourselves standing upon the shores of The Verdant Paradise 
that mercury had once been we immediately heard a transmission from St 14 who had been sent 
in this time with his Colonial Expedition by the speaker to reclaim Mercury the garden world 
for Humanity he had unwi wittingly run into the Fallen House of rain they were tearing his people 
apart the people that Saint had sworn to protect he was all that was left we rushed to his side 
intervening and pushing back the Fallen forces but Saint was broken in spirit proclaiming that things 
seemed hopeless after the battle in a moment that had been foretold we took the weapon that we had 
recovered from St 14's corpse the perfect paradox this shotgun that we had remade in the infinite 
Forge of the caloris lighthouse Spire we gifted it to Saint and his spirits were immediately 
lifted by the power of the weapon he was even more encouraged by what our ghost decided to show 
him next a holographic display of the city as it was in our time not some meager Camp Beneath The 
Traveler with barely a few High barricades as walls but a true thriving place of life and safety 
when we were pulled out we prepared quickly to head to the second set of coordinates but first we 
saw the changes in our timeline already starting to bear fruit we picked up an old distress signal 
from St 14's ghost jepetto when we went to recover it it was surrounded by dead Vex and showed us an 
audio playback of the moment of St 14's death time had already begun to change and so determined to 
prevent this tragedy from happening we followed the second set of coordinates we landed near 
where the tomb of St 14 had been where we found it in the infinite Forest but the Titan was still 
alive there was still hope here we got our chance to stop the construct that would have drained 
St 14's light and it would have left him dead for good we faced off against AGI octus even as it 
tried to capture Saint aotus was only programmed to drain the light of sa for specifically so 
when we fought the Martyr mind it was on an even footing it tried to contain us desperately 
as a last Gambit but before it could destroy us Saint Broke Free of his bonds and shattered the 
Martyr mind he had survived he had lived and now all of the forces of the infinite Forest would 
feel his wroth they had channeled all of their energy all of their production into making One 
Singular mind to counter him they would not be able to recreate one Saint thanked us for our 
assistance and stated that he would stay in the infinite Forest meeting us the long way round he 
would continue to fight the Vex in real time as we sped back to the present day and in front of 
one of the time locked Vex Gates that presented itself on Mercury by the lighthouse Sundial St 
14 stroe forth once again delivering yet more Vex to their graves even as he finally emerged from 
the infinite Forest we had done it thanks to the perfect Paradox and the Su dial we had changed 
the course of history we had returned a legend we had saved Saint 14 his return to the tower was 
a moment of awe and wonder and after much fanfare and celebration Saint and Osiris were able to 
take a moment for their long of a Jew reunion the return of the legendary Titan would do nothing 
to stop the Scions in their determination though with their control slipping tazaroc Nuru and oet 
began a process of merging to create a far more powerful force that might oppose the Guardians 
and Salvage their plan the merging would mean they would cease to exist subsumed into this 
greater construct amtech was told that if their plan failed she was to deliver their Vengeance 
and thus the other three flares ceased to be and their combined form of inotam was created but 
even their last desperate bid to stop us was not enough the flares fell and their control of the 
sundal was completely lost Osiris would move to quickly make plans to properly decommission the 
Sundial but not before we ventured once more into the corridors of time for ourselves initially 
our first investigations and Explorations were blind Endeavors but following the codes that had 
been discerned by some of the obelisks Osiris set up around the system we were able to make our way 
through the corridors to a deeper set of Chambers and in there we found something remarkable a 
time lost vault at its heart there was a grave but we couldn't actually reach its Center yet to 
do so we would need to take a longer and far more complicated pathway through the corridors that 
took a significant amount of time to map when we did finally complete the pathway we stood before 
the grave of a guardian and as the words of St 14 echoed out around us we learned that this was 
not just any grave it was our own we had just glimpsed our own death with all the uncertainty 
that a moment like that could bring we had saved St 14 by venturing into the corridors of time 
was it possible that we had doomed ourselves by Saving Saint to this day we still don't know as 
Saint read out our many titles and accomplishments we still did not know what had ended our lives 
perhaps we will find out when we venture into the pale heart of the traveler perhaps not but 
there would be many who would try between now and then the first would be amtech and she would 
try to take her Vengeance on the Guardians in what might be described as the greatest assault 
on on the city that never happened amch Vengeance would come from the sky and it would 
require another God's intervention to stop it [Music] it would not take long after their 
defeat at the sundal for the Scions to show just how dangerous they could truly be amtech 
might never have shown her face but she would know ours and she knew that in order to defeat 
the Guardians she would need to destroy the city and the traveler it was no good to just kill an 
individual when they could be resurrected she would need to find a way of severing their 
powers the cage was gone Gaul was defeated and the red Legion forces were mostly still 
scattered but there was one asset that still lay in the system it was her best bet for now 
the almighty her Scion Crews along with their cabal allies decoupled the Great Space Station 
from the direct orbit of the Sun and soon it was on the move again seeing this as a direct 
threat Zavala and Anna BR both boarded the space station and whilst they couldn't stop 
its engines they could determine its course it was here that they saw AMC's simple and yet 
terrifying plan it would be too late to stop the vessel now MCH Crews had plotted the vessel's 
trajectory they planned to collide the almighty with the last City and the traveler this was not 
merely the Collision of a large space station with Earth it would have been like a meteorite of 
significant enough size to cause an extinction level event across the planet amtech would have 
her Vengeance on humanity and upon the Guardians in a single decisive strike this would perhaps be 
the most cabal plan a Scion has ever come up with but luckily for us where the Brilliant Minds of 
the Scions would use brutality and would re Death from Above we would answer with a god of our own 
anab BR as always had a plan she went to Rasputin who was the one being within Soul capable of 
deploying the necessary orbital ordinance to stop the almighty before it hit Earth at significant 
impact velocity to create an extinction level event and more importantly to stop it from hitting 
the last City and the traveler and so there was a flurry of warmind activity around the system 
we deployed to his bunkers on the moon IO and Earth with the intent of rearming the war mind 
and preparing him for this great task over the coming months we would see the war mind change 
significantly it showed us not only that it was willing to learn from the errors of its past and 
from its own flaws but that it had come to regret many things that it had done from the murder of 
the iron Lords to the abandoning of humanity in the Golden Age there was something in particular 
that had caused a serious degree of change fail winter fa winter as it turned out had always 
been the key because felwinter was of course not merely just an iron Lord a guardian and an EXO 
felwinter had been a part of Rasputin a spy in the Golden Age an exoframe designated as a sedata 
Golem something which the war mind would use to walk amongst the people and better understand 
them when felwinter had been resurrected by The Traveler Rasputin saw it almost like a part of him 
being stolen and was struck with great jealousy but long after he had struck his own son down with 
cver Rasputin had suddenly realized the grief that he was feeling the regret of his actions on the 
moon he made a makeshift tomb for his own son and even held a copy of his weapon interred there 
from here we would claim the infamous weapon known as fell Winter's lie and we would see at very 
least that the war mind was beginning to grow there was an echo of something more something that 
Anna had helped nurture back in the golden age to this same end of showing his regret Rasputin 
would make an effort to approach Commander's zala and make inroads with him in order to 
gain his trust Rasputin showed him a map of the oncoming threat and all the information 
that he had accumulated from his new warsat network from this we realized that the almighty 
wasn't the only threat in Space the black Fleet had been gathering on the edges of our system in 
silence they were already here and Rasputin had mapped out their movements they would be in the 
inner reaches of the system within months when asked Rasputin why he was sharing this information 
the answer was given in an audio recording it was someone on Titan who had died at the beginning of 
the collapse someone that Rasputin had abandoned in a moment of need Rasputin had lived to regret 
more than just the death of his son he would not stand idly by and watch it happen again this time 
he would be the defender that Saul needed and he swore to stand side by side with the Guardians 
as an ally and an equal and to give his life if necessary and soon Rasputin would have his moment 
to prove this to us we had helped to launch the new warsats and soon Rasputin would position them 
around the almighty it brought down the Great Space Station before it could hit the last City 
and as its ruins fell towards the nearby mountains even though there was a Titanic explosion the last 
City still stood the Tyrant was now Humanity's great defender once more with allies like Rasputin 
it seemed as though we were now at the height of our power once again Humanity was back its great 
defender was back but even now we knew that the black fleet was approaching the great powers of 
the system were preparing for the approaching Doom they were not ready for it when it arrived 
it would return our worlds to a kind of Darkness that they had not known since the collapse but 
the preparation that the great powers of the system made for this Darkness did not begin with 
Rasputin alone it would also begin with Osiris before the black fleet's arrival Rasputin 
was approached by the old warlock Osiris felwinter had been Osiris's mentor and so it 
was natural for the Warlock to approach with skepticism he asked Rasputin which side of this 
great conflict it was on he did not trust the old war mind especially after he had killed his old 
Mentor but Rasputin would oblige Osiris by giving him the coordinates to some kind of deep space 
anomaly from this anomaly Osiris took a seed of Silver Wings we do not know if this place was one 
of the pyramid ships of the black Fleet we do not know if it was something older deeper darker but 
at Marv's Direction Osiris would plant this seed in the Cradle on iO the last place the traveler 
had touched down the seed grew into something magnificent a second tree of Silver Wings and as 
if drawn to its luminous boughs the Shadows soon followed the black fleet was here the return of 
the pyramid ships to the system brought with it a dread unlike any that had been felt before save 
for in the collapse within the opening moments of their arrival Rasputin did as he had sworn he 
would and responded with the full measure of his new power at first it looked as though he was 
successful but that notion was swiftly cast aside as the warind in but a single moment was all 
but destroyed our greatest protector had given his fullest measure at the first opportunity but 
it was not enough to stop even a single vessel of the black Fleet and for showing his teeth 
Rasputin had been quickly defanged we would be drawn to the black Fleet on one of their vessels 
had parked above the Cradle where the traveler had once sat we were sent there to investigate 
it but were swiftly abducted Once More by the pyramid it was in this moment that we could have 
been pulled into darkness and never seen again but something remarkably unexpected happened a hive 
portal opened up in front of us and transported us briefly to the ascendant plane before spitting 
us back out in the lower reaches of the approach to the Cradle someone had just prevented us from 
speaking with the black Fleet and we would later discover that it was savathun as time went on it 
would be made clear that each week she was trying to prevent us properly from reaching the tree of 
Silver Wings that Osiris had planted where the black fleet was reaching out to us to try and 
communicate to our Guardians teris MN had gone ahead of us and thanks to her additional knowledge 
that had been gained from interpreting the later messages of the artifact on the moon she had 
gained significant insights those insights would repeat each week allowing us continually to gain 
more and more knowledge from our Invaders but each week as we attempted to approach and learn more 
of the black Fleet savathun would try and stop us her whims were being carried out by another 
defeated supplicant from our past nocis who had Unbound himself from zol's service and newly 
dedicated himself to savathun instead as a part of his supplication he had gifted savathun with 
the knowledge of Hive necromancy something that should have been heresy for savathun to reflect 
upon and yet Perhaps it showed a greater intent as to what she was hoping to accomplish and it 
showed the direction in which she was veering and so a cycle of battles began every week at 
the vanguard's behest and with a great degree of caution with Aris mourn at our side we would 
secure the sight of the tree of Silver Wings and we would learn what we could of our foes from 
our foes it seemed over time as though they were trying to tempt us to invite us to use Darkness 
to join their side there were others who were also unsatisfied with this perspective that we were 
receiving from the black Fleet Chief amongst them was The Drifter he had used the light and dark 
before and knew that our perspective was limited and so he made a request of the nine and asked 
for them to explain the nature of light and dark alongside us and Eris mour we would experience 
a vision of sorts we were transported deep into the drifter's Hall where we experienced what 
would be referred to by the nine as a prophecy in this place that the nine had crafted we would 
learn from actions and from experience that the black fleet was here to take and invade our 
world worlds and that soon they would be lost to us in particular Mercury IO Titan and Mars more 
importantly though it gave us a piece of knowledge that would only be further reinforced as the years 
went on it showed us that the light and dark were not strictly forces bound to the perspectives 
of good and evil as we had believed they were Elemental forces of the universe as fundamental 
as time and gravity with no more moral agenda ER than a subatomic particle this Revelation 
was utterly fundamental for us to understand what would come next it gave us our first hint 
that the black fleet was not actually the truest form of Darkness but a usurper who had used it as 
a tool someone or something capable of manifesting it with great potency not its true Source not 
its true Master it also quietly pointed to the quite opposite possibility that the light could 
be wielded by one who was deemed Evil by us an idea that would matter well before the end as we 
continued to communicate with the black Fleet we would start to see the tree of Silver Wings 
change every atom within its structure was being fought for by the paracausal energies 
of light that remained on iO and the emerging darkness of the pyramid vessel above every single 
element within its structure was changing and the Darkness was winning this would be but a single 
sign of many our worlds were potentially doomed after many tests it was determined that the 
pyramid vessels were impregnable nothing would get past their shielding technology nothing 
could break through Ash air even discovered that when struck the vessels teleported all hostile 
Munitions into a different dimension they did not even detonate they did not even strike their 
targets true the worlds under threat were given an order by Commander zala they were to prepare for a 
general evacuation and a retreat to the last City many would follow this order but some decided to 
stay on Mercury the Assyrian cultist brother Vance would step forth into the infinite forest and 
would attempt to understand more of the beautiful dark song that the caloris spires had made his 
fate is unnown but it is speculated to have been Grim on Titan the vanguard's deputy Commander 
Sloan had discovered a golden age power suit that allowed her an unparalleled degree of strength 
she stayed behind to hold off the forces that claimed Titan for their own knowing that she would 
fight alone and she might never win and that she would face these trials in the deepest Darkness 
imaginable on iO the Warlock Aamir decided to a stay to attempt to prevent the secrets of the 
Vex network from falling into the possession of the black Fleet as we left for the last time he 
would enter the pyramidan where he had lost his arm to the Vex mind brachon years ago and would 
immerse himself into the Vex Network becoming a whisper within its code where he could discover 
the secrets that the Vex held secrets that would be crucial for us to uncover in the coming years 
secrets that would lead him to the veil but on Mars the hunter anab did decide to retreat but 
not before salvaging everything she could of the war mind thanks to her ghost jingu and some quick 
thinking she was able to save a massive amount of Rasputin's core code and store it with an aillery 
engram she would return to the last City with this engram and the remains of a project that 
would occupy her next few years a prototype EXO body that would work as a core framework to try 
and rebuild the war mind in the end Mars IO Titan and Mercury would all be abducted by the witness 
and its black Fleet taken by the same power that had allowed orx to create his taken for a time 
these worlds would be lost to us but before they were taken completely we were able to commune with 
the black Fleet One Last Time as the corruption completely consumed the tree of silver wings but 
now as we were intercepted one more time in this last most pressing of moments we were drawn into 
what we believed was the court of savathun and took the fight directly to nocis himself his 
true death rang out across the ascendant plain and in its aftermath he was not there to prevent 
the pyramids from abducting us deeper into their innermost Chambers and our ghost was possessed 
again its voice changed to what we had heard when we had first ventured into the pyramid on Luna the 
same voice that had spoken to us in the vision of the black garden barely a year and it was back it 
told us that ancient power awaited us on Europa and that it would be ours for the taking we also 
saw a strange scene before us a pyramid vessel within a pyramid vessel an effigy of it floating 
before us surrounded by adoring worshippers from many different species with this final message 
from the black Fleet in our minds and the worlds that we had once called our territory abducted we 
gathered in the last City and bore witness to an event as terrifying as it was Majestic with the 
black fleet's return the traveler was responding reacting to the encroaching Darkness as its old 
enemy had returned it began to reform itself the broken pieces of its shell that had orbited 
it since the end of the red War began to slot back into place a wave of great light across the 
system signaled the Traveler's response to the black Fleet it would defend itself the question 
remained what would its Guardians do when tempted with an entirely different kind of power a power 
that awaited Us in the icy heart of Europa [Music] we had heard the call of the black Fleet 
it beckoned us to the icy Moon of Europa it promised us salvation it promised us power as 
was our nature and our duty we had to investigate what was going on but we weren't the first to 
arrive on this icy Moon prior to our touchdown Eris mour and The Drifter would both set foot on 
the moon's surface and would meet with a figure of infamy at long last it was time for the exost 
stranger to step out of the shadows and introduce herself properly as we had learned some time ago 
it was indeed Elsie br Bray the sister of anab and granddaughter to Clovis Bray I first who had been 
the exost stranger she had come in this moment of great need to instruct Eris and The Drifter 
on how to use the powers of Darkness both Aris and The Drifter had embraced a new power stasis 
an element of control and will that manifested as Cosmic ice sapping the energy from things 
and forcing them into a state of submission Elsie also knew this power and would teach them 
both to use it without fear of falling to its corruption this was a departure from Elsie's 
previous actions in previous timelines in many of the timelines that had come before she was a 
prisoner of sorts she would always see repeated timelines of evolving Fates she would always be 
able to intervene but in every timeline prior she had lost the forces of the witness had been 
triumphant the forces of good had failed commonly this would occur when someone obtained stasis and 
didn't have a guiding hand to help them control this Darkness Elsie made a change to her plans 
this time and in this cycle instead of trying to lock stasis away a plan that inevitably failed she 
decided that she would teach us to use it in those previous dark timelines Aris mour had betrayed the 
tower and become a terrible dark god of the hive with little care for her human comrades now with 
those powers under her control we stood a Fighting Chance neither her nor The Drifter would fall to 
corruption they would be staunch allies but as the nine predicted long ago all Fates were converging 
on us and we would need to tread this same path without wavering if there was to be a chance 
for Humanity and all of existence to survive when we arrived on Europa we saw that the 
pyramids were already there and quickly picked up a distress signal from varic the loyal 
he had not been seen since he instigated the riot at the prison of Elders but now he offered help 
to us and was asking for help in return we were not the first to reach the old scribe though his 
new Taskmaster that he had once again chosen to portray was hot on his Trail and quick quickly 
she found him as he tried to send his pleas out to the rest of the system his new leader would 
be Aramis the Kell of a new Rising Fallen house within herself she had discovered a new resolve 
born of hatred this came after her failure to recover sver instead of looking to the old ways 
she had discovered a means to use an entirely new power she had ventured to Europa and immersed 
herself in the dark power of the black Fleet now she too wielded stasis a power that was quickly 
corrupting her as varx could see with her reformed band have fallen behind her she created a new 
house known as the house of Salvation and told them of how they with their new power would no 
longer be bound to the fate of the great machine they would be freed in darkness and stasis would 
be how they fought back she commanded her forces to kill varx but we arrived just after she left 
with just enough time to save the Scribe he told us to spare him despite his actions leading to 
the death of Cade together we had to focus on Aramis and we had to stop her before she could 
use her dark powers to create any further evil so we ventured straight to her stronghold a new 
Alex City built on top of Humanity's Golden Age ruins Reese reborn there we saw aramis's command 
of stasis and realized that it was too strong to confront we were forced into a hasty Retreat 
returning to VAR we would yet again start to hear the voice of the witness through our ghost yet 
again it attempted to draw Us in and it beckoned us to a lonely ice shelf far off in the wasts of 
Europa in those wastes a zigurat from the pyramid ships set down awaiting our arrival before we 
could reach it Elsie Bray Eris mour and The Drifter intercepted us and after seven long years 
of absence at last Elsie had time to explain she told us of the terrible truth that we would 
need to learn how to use stasis in order to conquer our foes and with her guidance we took 
our first step steps at first we would need to use the splinters from the black fleet's vessels 
to control our stasis Powers Aramis had hunted down vars initially because he had stolen one 
of them acquiring more splinters over time gave us more control and a greater connection to our 
stasis Powers we would acquire these splinters from some of aramis's Greater commanders such 
as Praxis the technocrat and filx the warrior in the process we also weakened aramis's dark 
counsil and removed powerful advisers from her side she became more and more Reckless and thus 
her vulnerabilities could be exploited Commander Zavala would eventually take note and arrived on 
Europa to give us some necessary intelligence and something of addressing down we would need to 
be controlled now that we had this strange dark power and more importantly a threat assessment 
needed to be made Zavala made it clear that he did not approve of our use of stasis but he still 
gave us the intelligence we needed to continue our fight namely that Aramis had sent raiding 
parties to the cosmodrome including one of her subcommanders known as bis we went to the cosmo 
Drome and prevented the house of devils aramis's old house from reinforcing the house of Salvation 
with dozens of spider tanks aramus would grow more desperate still heading to the Vex portal on 
Europa to unleash the Vex there these forces would slow us down or perhaps kill us if Aramis 
was lucky varx pleaded with her not to do this though it would be harmful to her own people but 
she would not be swayed she claimed that all her actions were made in service to Reese and to 
her people the portal that opened at the end of the glass way led to a Vex Forge star known as 
valantis 2 2082 and soon the Vex would begin to pour forth from it the radiolarian fluid poured 
through the portal as well and it flowed once more to the place where it had been sent long ago 
the Deep Stone Crypt where the exos were born and where another of aramis's commanders atrax awaited 
it with her own dark purposes in mind with the Vex pouring forth they began to swarm Reese reborn and 
it provided us with an opportunity to strike out at Aramis for good we ascended to the summit of 
the Fallen City and faced the Kell of Darkness her power of stasis was great and we had learned to 
control our own instead of allowing it to control us our power came not from the splinters but from 
within and Aramis could stand against us for only so long she was frozen in place by the very power 
that she claimed would be her Liberation the witness does not abide failure and whilst it had 
failed to corrupt us Aramis had failed in turn to kill us so she would bear the brunt she would be 
imprisoned for her failure here until the witness saw a use for her again her power was momentarily 
ended but a few of her commanders still remained the house of Sal ation would not be so easily 
killed even after the death of its Kell and so we had to hunt them down as well first there was 
credtis the dark Priestess who made herself quite visible and was easy to hunt but the remaining 
commanders under aramis's Banner had fled to an even deeper installation within Europa they had 
fled to the deepstone Crypt Elsie made it clear that we needed to pursue them with all haste 
europa's greatest secrets could not fall into the hands of the House of Salvation the Crypt was 
defended by an unconventional AI of sorts as well as many of the house salvation troops that had 
accompanied aramis's remaining commanders the AI warned us against interfering with the Crypt and 
let us know that the response should we ignore it would be calamitous but we had to stop the 
house of Salvation And in the deepest parts of the crypt we saw for the last two leaders one of 
whom was very familiar there was atrax who had used the power of the deepstone crypt to become 
one of the first EXO elix dozens of copies of her spread out throughout the facility ready 
to do battle with us and then there was tanx the scar the legendary Fallen mercenary who had 
no house and would kneel before no Banner until Aramis gave him a cause Worthy of his prowess as 
we discovered tanx we also discovered the veiled statue that had been used by Clovis bray to alter 
the collected radiolarian fluid from the glass way it turned out that this altered fluid was a 
critical component to creating the exos the great secret of their creation was revealed there was 
Darkness within all of them every single one TX flared into orbit bit where Clover spray's space 
station the morning star was waiting locked geoc synchronously to the deepstone Crypt below we 
would need to Transit between the Crypt and the station in order to reach tanx but not before 
defeating nearly a dozen copies of atrax one whether we truly ended her life or not is still up 
for debate but regardless we all ended up at the top of the Morning Star station ready to pursue 
the last commander of the House of Salvation as we went deeper into the Morning Star station 
the AI once again contacted us and made it clear that we were out of warnings and that the nuclear 
descent protocol would be initiated in response it praised the name and the genius of Clovis Bray and 
what we had discovered there stating that it would be destroyed and that it was somehow the font of 
eternal life as we discovered tanx the station's orbit was destabilized and its nuclear cores were 
activated it began to plummet towards Europa if it made contact and the nukes weren't disarmed the 
entire Moon would be destroyed along with everyone on its surface tanx and the house of Salvation 
troops that were on board were still trying to stop us as we all plummeted from space but we did 
manage despite their meddling to some the nuclear warheads aboard the morning star and before we 
were destroyed by the impact we found a modum of safety inside a sealed room tanx was not so lucky 
he just managed to miss the door but he was far more resilient than we had initially realized as 
we climbed out of the wreckage of the station we were back in front of the crypt the entirety of 
europa's surface would be covered in the wreckage of the Morning Star the whole station had come 
crashing down and the Crypt was breached and there in front of the crypt we discovered the true 
extent of tx's resilience for ourselves he emerged as a terrifying construct of metal and Malice 
this was perhaps his last Gambit his last form the remaining nuclear warheads from The Morning 
Star had been incorporated into his chassis and we needed to continually disarm them as 
we pushed to destroy this monster like Cade did so long ago we put an end to tanx but this 
time he wouldn't be coming back as tanx fell and the Crypt was unlocked the deepest secrets 
of Europa were revealed to us as it turned out the Crypt AI that we had been interacting with 
was no AI at all it was the reactivated remnants of Clovis Bray the first his story on Europa is 
a strange one as it turns out two copies of his mind were made one had ended up on Europa and 
had stayed here in this giant mechanical head it was about as close to the original Clovis as 
it had always been but the other copy had become an EXO an EXO whose first designation was Clovis 
one that version of Clovis Bray long ago in the Golden Age had been one of the leaders who helped 
to Rally the exos to fight off the invading Vex the Vex that had originally come from the forge 
star valantis 2082 the exos shut down the Vex gate and Clovis sacrificed himself with many EXO 
resets in order to accomplish this with that in mind he decided to change his name going instead 
from Clovis 43 on his last reset to a new name when he became his 44th EXO iteration he would be 
named after the whale of his sword the nickname that had been given to him as he cut down 
countless of Vex he would become Banshee 44 as it turned out he had been alongside Us in 
the tower this whole time as our faithful but very forgetful gunsmith exos are not meant to be 
reset that many times and so it isn't surprising that banshi didn't remember the Clovis AI would 
begrudgingly help us to learn the last of stasis secrets and we would ultimately gain Mastery 
over the element for ourselves without the risk of corruption with that we had learned a 
fundamental truth Darkness was not evil just in the same way that light was not inherently good 
appearances weren't what they seemed and those of previously unscrupulous or evil intentions could 
turn from that dark us to see the side of good and we would learn that lesson many times not least 
of which when we returned to the Tangled Shore [Music] as the conflict on Europa continued to 
unfold another front had opened up in the new war for the system this time in The Reef The 
Hive God of War had suddenly made her presence known savathun and orx had wandered in this 
system before but now it was time for Zorra to make her presence known Osiris would investigate 
this new presence in the system as he discovered numerous hive structures biological in nature 
known as cryptolith they were of Zeus's design and from her horde and could be used to extend 
her control of minions under her command far and wide but these were not simply Hive many cabal 
and Fallen would also fall under the sway of zeor Wrath with these cryptolith being like hubs 
of control those that fell to Zeus's wandering strength would be risen as what was known as 
the Wrath born and they would be a plague upon our system in much the same way as many of the 
other Hive minions had been as Osiris continued his search and sought to understand more he was 
caught by the wondering eye of zeu wrath's high celebrant Osiris was cornered and in a moment 
where Zeo wrath Unleashed her power upon him he was struck down in this moment of Terror Osiris 
survived but his ghost sagira was destroyed Osiris lost his connection to the light that day we 
swiftly pursued Osiris who had chased the high celebrant into the hellmouth attempting to secure 
Vengeance for sagira however without his light he was not only mortal but far weaker he did not have 
the command of any force that he had had before and his aims of avenging his ghost by taking on 
something far greater than a typical Hive Overlord was a foolish Ploy at best his life was nearly 
ended by a typical Hive Knight we found him just before the night struck but so did a familiar 
face who stepped out of the Shadows at the edge of our vision with an awoken blade gutting 
the high night before it could end Osiris it was alren or rather it was uldren's risen form 
the lightbearer known as Crow Crow and Osiris returned with us and headed to the Tangled Shore 
as it turned out in the 2 years since he had been risen in the light Crow had found himself in the 
employ of the spider who had found him after the resurrection and press ganged him into service the 
spider had secured Crow's cooperation by placing an explosive charge beneath glint outer shell 
ensuring that if Crow ever stepped too far out of line a simple flip of a switch could end Crow's 
power his ghost and his mortality given the number of times that stray Guardians had discovered Crow 
and seen the face of alren s killing him for the pleasure of it this was an imminent threat one 
that Crow had to take seriously he had seen a system that shot back at him at every opportunity 
that gave him no reason to trust others and that told him that everyone was a danger no matter 
what but these were not the concerns of the spider Pro was simply another tool to him and the 
spider had bigger opportunities and problems he stated that we could have any treasure within his 
vast collection his vast horde if we helped him hunt down zeor wrath's high celebrant and rid 
the shore of her influence the presence of the Wrath born was bad for business we would oblige 
and over the coming months we would do just this hunting down the high celebrants minions and the 
Wrath born forces wherever we found them in this time Crow would slowly prove to not only be a 
valuable Ally but also a completely different person from the man who had coldly claimed the 
life of Cade 6 he had a sincere drive to do good a moral compass that often bent strongly towards the 
Ark of justice and an unbiased love for the people of every species of this city system be they human 
awoken or Alix much like the oldest versions of alren s that Mara might have remembered from the 
distributary crow would see the good in everyone he delighted in telling stories to Children he 
delighted in the simple good of friendship and we began to see for ourselves that there was 
indeed good in him that this was not the same villain who had killed Cade and that this was 
not the same cold Prince that we had met upon our first moments entering the reef this was a 
different man Aldren and Crow were not the same working together alongside Crow we managed to 
save him at least once during our hunt for the high celebrant the great Hive Commander had fled 
into the ascendant realm near the dreaming City and was taken out thanks to our combined efforts 
Crow would be thankful for our interference and ultimately realized that working together we 
could not only be friends but also a powerful team we were the first Guardians that he had truly 
worked alongside in any professional manner for any extended period of time there was a kinship 
there and he had proven himself to be an ally worthy of our time we returned successful to The 
Spider and when the time came to claim our prize we named The Crow buying his freedom from the 
spider's shackles it enraged the spider but a deal was a deal and so he acquest when Crow asked why 
we told him our simple answer he was a guardian this was something Crow would learn to reaffirm 
as he began to receive Visions from The Traveler they manifested first as paracausal feathers that 
we followed across the system feather feathers that spoke about Visions from Crow's perspectives 
through these feathers we relived some of Crow's dreams and he would confirm to us again that he 
had indeed been dreaming sometimes he was seeing a hawk sometimes he was a hawk and The Visions 
always led us to A Shard of the traveler in the edz we went to investigate this place and there 
we literally found a paracausal hawk of pure light following this Hawk just like cro had done 
in the dreams would indeed lead us to A Shard of the traveler and there something was waiting for 
us a broken Effigy of a weapon from our past Hawk Moon it was nothing but a shell but with the aid 
of the light it could be remade this weapon was made of the same material as the Traveler's outer 
shell a paracausal flesh That Grew and glowed with potential as Crow unraveled more of his dream 
dreams and Visions the weapon was slowly forming into the paracausal tool that he would one day 
call his own cleansing the corruption of the taken would allow us to finally claim the weapon as our 
own after many repeated pilgrimages to The Shard to improve upon Hawk Moon's design Crow to would 
acknowledge the truth that we could already see at first he had rejected the idea of being another 
puppet for a greater being in a grand game but if eventually he saw the truth he was a guardian 
an instrument of the Traveler's will he knew his place he knew his purpose in celebration of this 
fact there would be much mert and drinking but Osiris would gift Crow with something remarkable 
a new set of robes a new cloak and a mask using the mask and this new Garb Crow would be able to 
take steps into the last City without the fear of other the Guardians attacking him for knowing 
who he was and as the threat of zor Wrath faded away Crow had that chance to prove himself as 
a new and true Guardian it would become even clearer than ever in time heralded by the sound 
of stomping feet and heavy metal once more the cabal were on the March but this time they were 
not the cabal that we had known the Scout Legions the red Legion they were all broken their leaders 
scattered this time we would face not a legion but a people not an Imperium but an ascendancy 
commanded not by a Dominus but by an empress the defeat of Zeus's forces was impressive 
not only to spider but also to a watching pair of eyes from Far Beyond Saul's borders 
Empress kitle daughter of callus and gaul's co-conspirator in the midnight coup she 
reached out to the Vanguard with an offer she would join her forces with ours and fight 
by our side against the darkness and The Hive in return all we had to do was swear allegiance to 
her and submit one from amongst our own ranks to sit on her war council as a brus subservience 
and safety at the price of Freedom this was not a choice that Zavala was willing to make he 
rejected the empress's offer but true to her word and to her honor she would not make war on us for 
a simple refusal of an alliance on her own terms Zavala and Osiris were permitted time to leave 
unharmed but from this first meeting we risked a cold war with what remained of the cabal Empire 
kitle had arrived in a whirlwind fashion from Toro Bartle and was calling for all of the legions 
in Saul to join to her cause with great hate she offered them glory in the ways of old of the 
cabal and a place of honor if they could rise to become one of her chosen Warriors behind this 
urgent marshalling of forces there was a bitter tragedy at play kitle had seen the cabal home 
world of Tor battle fall to zeor wrath's forces she didn't just want Supremacy in Saul like Gaul 
did she needed an alliance with the zor wrath's enemies and she needed the remaining forces of the 
Scout Legions and red Legions she didn't want the light itself she wanted the aid of the light 
to save her people but she had just asked us to bow to her when our home had been invaded by 
her very own soldiers they had brought Humanity low and had nearly destroyed us we could not 
simply oblige her and could not provide her with the alliance that she sought on her own terms the 
war that brewed between the Vanguard and the for of Kyle's ascendancy never boiled over into 
proper conflict instead we would play a delicate diplomatic and pseudo military game of sorts 
kitle was inviting great champions from across the system and with enough support she would 
easily rally all of the cabal forces they would then easily be able to force the Vanguard into 
submission through a more deadly proposition than the original Alliance and thus Osiris opted for a 
different strategy we would personally enter into the trials that kidle was putting forward 
for her forces and as we entered we would destroy the competition preventing any successful 
champions from emerging amongst the remnants this would keep Kyle's forces weak and if nothing 
else would mean that the empress would need more time to Rally her forces Osiris would also 
adopt another change Crow had been brought into the city and would be alongside him and acted as 
security for both himself and Commander zala Crow would always wear his mask though in order to keep 
his identity secret only in moments of silence and Solitude would he remove it one night within 
the city Gardens Zavala also sought solitude but neither he nor Crow was alone a Sion assassin 
had been placed within the city walls and their goal was to take the life of the commander before 
they could carry out their mission Zavala spotted them and quickly dispatched of them but not before 
Commander Zavala saw his face and for but a moment beheld the man who had killed his best friend for 
a brief Glimpse Crow wasn't discovered properly that night but the mystery of the situation didn't 
end there through various Communications kitle insisted that she would not send for forces to 
assassinate her Rivals and at this point in time that notion made sense kisel had acted with honor 
and if she wished to employ underhanded tactics in her battle against us we would likely have seen it 
earlier in play there was a point at which Scion snipers directly aimed their scopes at zala and 
Osiris in the first meeting but kitle had let them leave she had not ordered them to be killed there 
even though she could have using an assassin did not seem to be her style something else was 
at play here regardless this turn of events accelerated tensions within the Vanguard and so 
Zavala Saladin and Osiris agreed on a risky Gambit Zavala would invoke the right of proving two cabal 
Champions would traditionally face off against each other in this ancient practice but instead we 
Guardians would face Kittle's chosen Champion oven aboard one of her Imperial land tanks if we won 
an Armistice would be agreed to on our terms and the cabal and Humanity would at very least be at 
peace for now but if kitle won her original terms would be satisfied and Zavala would join as a 
braus humanity and the Guardians would become a client species of the cabal Empire and the 
Vanguard would effectively be dissolved oven even though though he was a powerful cabal was 
no match for a paracausal force that had slain gods and with new powers of Darkness at our side 
they were quite simply not ready for us with our victory in hand kitle was forced to honor the 
agreement the Armistice was ready to be signed kitle and Zavala met on nessus accompanied by 
various dignitaries and Crow on our side of things they were ready to Proclaim their agreement 
in blood but in the background yet more Scion assassins were at work and this time they had a 
new tool up their sleeve they had secretly stolen remnants of the technology that had been used to 
create the cage around the traveler whilst at the beginning of the red War this might have been 
a giant machine now the sect of Assassins had worked secretly to create a miniaturized version 
of the technology that would be able to drain the light from a guardian by caging their ghost thus 
rendering them mortal zavala's ghost targe was hit by one such round and temporarily Zavala became 
mortal the sniper had made a perfect opening for a Scion close to Zavala to strike him down Crow 
took the initial blow meant to end the Commander's life and his mask was shattered In This Moment 
his cover was blown that sacrifice would have been for nothing if the next swing against zala 
had actually landed but proving her honor and knowing that this would be the undoing of any 
possible peace between her and the Guardians kitle grabbed the Scion lifted it into the air 
and slammed It To The Ground killing it before it could land the blow swiftly she insisted 
that she had not ordered this attack but that she would be able to find the perpetrators and 
so the Armistice went forward commanders zala's ghost Taj was freed and zala looked upon the 
man who had saved him when he saw the face of alren sov he realized what had happened this was 
not the prince of the reef that had stolen away cate's life and so he did not aim a mortal blow 
in Crow's Direction especially considering that Crow had just saved his life instead he extended 
a hand of friendship and brought him to his feet now that saala knew he would work alongside us to 
keep Crow's identity secret within the Vanguard until everyone was ready to accept him for who he 
was few others would be allowed to know of Crow's true identity this included Amanda Holliday the 
tower's ship right who had been one of Cade's closest and most trusted friends unwittingly 
Amanda and Crow would become friends as well both of them being oblivious to the man that Crow 
had once been and the sins of his past life for the for the time being though there were other 
occurrences throughout the system that needed our attention none more troubling than the story 
of the glycon the cabal forces had picked up a deep space anomaly near Mars it was a pocket of 
Darkness unlike anything that we'd ever seen and yet it seemed as though it might give us a hint at 
to what had happened to our stolen planets a lost cabal vessel had been sending out a distress call 
and we would steal the coordinates to this vessel from cabal forces though kitle certainly wouldn't 
approve this theft led us on the trail of one of the darkest discoveries we had ever known the 
discovery of Call's secret research vessel the glycon volatus for months it had been loitering 
near the reef and had been abducting scorn for experimentation callus was attempting to use 
these dead things as a method of communing with the witness it had reached out to C long ago and 
told him of the encroaching end and callus was determined to be its Herald but for so long it 
had not responded to his calls it took a strange combination of scorn experiments reanimated again 
and again and placed within the crown of Sorrow to actually commune with the witness but when he did 
successfully commune callus suddenly vanished from The Vessel and the records of a guardian aboard 
who briefly survived the encounter only to dilate her told us of what had happened next and his 
records of what happened on the glycon describe it like a scene from hell he states that the ship 
had been dragged Beyond Aaron's wall it had been pulled down into an underworld when we boarded 
the ship it was infested with scorn and all the cabal crew were dead but we also found a different 
kind of estation here strange spores of Darkness this would be our first ever interaction with 
the strange fungal life form known as egregor a vast web of fungal spores built upon the fabric of 
death itself as we delved deeper into the vessel we realized that we needed to use these spores in 
order to access deeper parts of it connecting to that Network opened our mind and would allow 
us to see things in a deeper perspective one that left us somewhat vulnerable as well as it 
leaves our mind open to other outside influences whenever we ran these missions Osiris and kitle 
would run tactical with us and Osiris was able to find and decrypt various logs from the glycon he 
found katabasis his story and we found our way to what remained of him here he would was strung 
up in eor consumed his ghost had brought him back so many times that it refused to resurrect 
him again and katabasis had had to put him down the only thing left to remember the Dead Man's 
tail by was his weapon a beautiful piece of tech mechanica Engineering also strung up in egregor 
for good measure but there was something else near the remains of kapac we found the remance of the 
dark artifact that had caused so much Strife we found what was left of the crown of Sorrow it was 
given to Osiris so that he might investigate it further and so that he might contain it safely 
should the need arise though the darkness of the crown was what callus had used to link to 
the witness it's worth remembering that prior to that moment it had been placed on the head of 
galran and it had served another dark master and soon she would make her next move Nightfall was 
coming delivered unto us by the machinations of savathun greetings everyone my name is B here 
again just really quickly jumping in here to say thank you for watching and I hope you're enjoying 
so far and also to thank again the sponsors of this video geology you can go ahead and check 
the code Down Below in the description to get yourself quite the discount thank you again to 
geology for sponsoring this video I hope you all have a happy intermission and I'll see you when 
we get back for season of the splicer [Music] you our not shortly after we signed the Armistice 
with Kit's forces tragedy befell the city once again seemingly out of nowhere one night 
the sun would set over the last City and then the next morning it would not rise it was quickly 
discerned that the last city had been cast into an endless night because of a Vex simulation that 
had prevented the Sun from casting its luminance on the city this Endless Night was in itself a 
terrible threat it could mean an increase in the lawlessness of the city in the short term but 
it would also mean long-term problems dwindling crops and food production a lack of solar power 
generation and a general rise in the unrest of the city all the while there was the mood across 
the city that things could potentially get even worse nobody understood the true extent of the 
vex's power or whether this was the precursor to an invasion that they might soon make but I cor 
Ray had a plan whilst there were experts on the Vex within their own ranks this particular issue 
required an all together different touch we had previously interacted with the alexes bioengineers 
body hackers and masters of machines the splicers as it turned out we had also met with an Alex 
that was inclined to help us an elix who was well versed in these skills mythrax the formerly 
forsaken had been working in the background to grow his Alix House of light and had made some 
great strides toward his goal of creating allies of the great machine we picked up his signal on 
Europa and helped to defend him and his people against a group of Vex that had shot down his 
fleeing skiff to save off the vex mythrax used his skill as a splicer to open a portal for us 
into the Vex Network itself we did not enter some simulation that day this was the first 
of many strides into the true network of the Vex and our light allowed us to Traverse it in a 
manner that only the most skilled of elix splicers could hope to achieve after we destroyed the mind 
that was commanding the local Vex a great hostile presence began to loom over us within the network 
work overriding mythra's control attempting to destroy us before we could Escape mythrax ported 
us to safety but we got a momentary Glimpse at the enormous Vex construct that was responsible before 
we were pulled back to Europa surface aora knew that mythra's people would continue to be hunted 
and harried if they were left out like this in the snow and so she offered them what might be the 
most extraordinary Olive Branch in the history of Saul she offered to give them homes and 
a place to stay within the last City itself mythrax graciously accepted understanding that 
both the people of the city and his own people would soon experience a great degree of turbulence 
before true peace could be achieved to say that the Vanguard inviting the elix into the city's 
walls would be seen by many as a betrayal would be an understatement the Golden Age had seen 
utopian ethics existing amongst most of the human population but ever since the collapse 
those times were long gone ages of progress were overturned and people knew fear and hatred 
again in particular the ugly rise of xenophobia within the last City's population would see a 
notable uptick with the house of light's arrival now there were targets easy targets at that some 
particularly shrewd political figures would look to exploit this fact in particular lsh me too of 
the future War cult she was a primary disruptor in this period of time and would regularly stoke the 
fires of such hate there were convenient and often in some cases legitimate concerns that she could 
raise as Shields and cloaks to hide or defend any more egregious positions that her followers 
might take after all someone being your enemy for a 100 years gives a very convenient pretex 
text for you to make whatever rules for them you decide but such issues are complicated and to say 
that the whole of the city was United against the house of light would also be incorrect after all 
the house of light were all refugees just like every person who had come to call the city home 
either they were Asylum seekers in their own age themselves or they had descended from someone who 
had been an asylum seeker and they had all come to shelter Beneath The Traveler what were they to do 
in previous generations no matter who it had been the citizens of the last city had not pulled up 
the ladder behind them they had welcomed all to beneath the Traveler's safety when lakmi 2 stoked 
the worst instances of hate there were some that pushed back even some from within the ranks of the 
future War cult who left and decided that it was very clear the direction she was going in was not 
one they could abide by but even as the popular of the last city was split there were other more 
important figures who would need convincing of all the great Heroes of the tower it was Saint 
14 who would be the most influential voice in this matter mithrax approached him in the spirit 
of fairness each time they spoke and Saint was naturally somewhat combative after having seen 
the devastation of the battle of the six fronts and the battle of the Twilight Gap firsthand he 
had crusaded against the Fallen houses and had seen them butcher his people in the distant past 
on Mercury winning his trust would be something of a mountain to climb one day the elix quarter was 
vandalized by one of lakshmi's xenophobic mobs and their ether stes were destroyed now the 
house of light truly had nothing after Saint investigated the scene he flippantly remarked 
that there were no Witnesses and that people could not be expected to live alongside those 
that they had always considered to be monsters to this mythrax took a moment and with a Stern 
tone enlightened Saint with regard to his own perspective revealing to him a story that would 
change him forever that there had been a monster to the Alexy all along a monster that they told 
their children about Saint heard his own story that day but retold from the perspective of 
the elix in this retelling his Crusades were not great Journeys out into the wild to deliver 
Justice unto the Fallen houses they were brutal and merciless campaigns of Slaughter in which he 
had killed thousands of innocent elix this moment opened his eyes particularly with this very simple 
note he was the monster that the elix parents told their children of they spoke of his insatiable 
Rage of how no elix were innocent in his eyes that they were all Fallen St could see this reality 
himself when he looked into the eyes of the elix children one day one fell in his path and as he 
offered a hand to help them up they recoiled in fear saint has always defended the innocent and A 
Moment Like This broke something within him he had always believed himself to be the great protector 
of the city's people but knowing that children trembled at his passing or even the shadow that 
he left on the the wall or even the mention of his name it challenged Saint to change his ways and it 
forced him to realize that the world he had seen as black and white was far more complicated than 
he had ever given it credit for from then onward much to his credit he would change his stance and 
became one of the staunchest advocates for the elix people together Saint and mithrax worked as 
one to counter the challenges within the city and without after all Saint may have been enlightened 
but that did nothing to stop the endless night so together we continuously worked within the Vex 
Network to understand how the endless Knight was being formed why it was being formed and what 
could be done to stop it delving deeper into their Network we learned how to better use our splicer 
abilities and after many different incursions into different nodes in their system we discovered 
that the Vex were being controlled by a single mind that was responsible for the Endless Night 
pursuing an understanding of which mind this was would lead us deeper into their Network where we 
began to see the telltale signs of the true threat behind the Endless Night deepen the Vex Network 
taken infestation surrounded the nodes containing the information we needed as we uncovered more 
it became clear that the Vex mind trolling the infinite Knight was none other than quarrier 
the blade transform this ancient Vex mind was the same one that had invaded the court of orex 
long ago and which orex had taken before gifting to the witch Queen savathun she was the reason for 
the Endless Night this was all a part of her plan descending upon quara's location we confronted 
this powerful Vex mind and purged it from the Vex Networks bringing the Endless Night to a 
close at last but even as quaria was destroyed and we stopped to remember those that we had lost 
the politics of the alix's arrival was still a cause for some uproar in the city and Lakshmi 
was still willing to exploit that moment for political gain but Lakshmi had had a few other 
factors that steered her towards her path the future War cult had long possessed a device that 
she could use to see a ser series of potential Futures they had used it prior to the red War to 
preemptively evacuate and arm as many civilians as they could now Lakshmi looked into the device 
and saw a future where she could potentially rule the city as a single dominant dictator a future in 
which the elix were cast out and where mithrax was put on trial this and a few Choice words from the 
Warlock Osiris would be the catalyst that sparked her next action Lakshmi gathered supporters of the 
FWC and new monarchy to her side and rounded up every Alex in the city before the Vanguard could 
do anything to respond she would follow Osiris's directions and opened up a portal in The botsa 
District in an attempt to banish the house of light into the void of space but unwittingly she 
had been deceived for some time it seemed like Osiris wasn't truly him himself and this feeling 
was all the more confirmed when the portal lakshi opened at his direction did not lead into the 
vacuum of space but instead led to the Vex network from there the botsa district began to be overrun 
Vex poured forth from the portal directly into the last City Lakshmi was killed in the opening 
engagement immediately Guardians responded to the incursion in force mobilizing with all available 
forces within the city's walls in order to enter the network once more and cut off the Vex in 
cursion meanwhile though Vex had already escaped and were running rampant in the Alix quarter St 14 
quickly made his way to the scene and when mithrax stated that he should be elsewhere to defend his 
people Saint retorted instinctively You Are My People as we shut down the Gateway St 14 myth ra 
aor Ray Commander Zavala and Amanda holiday all converged on the botza district destroying what 
remained of the Vex the elix house of light had been saved more accurately the people of the last 
city had been saved the remaining elements of the factions would see this as a chance to leave 
the city and in the aftermath the factions functionally ceased to exist there would be no 
more factions on the consensus there would be no more factions at all the city was left in a 
state of political limbo meaning that the only true commanding Force within the city would be 
the Vanguard aor Ray and Commander ofala but the political turmoil and ramifications of this moment 
would have to wait for a day in the farlong future there was another who had quietly slipped away 
from the city in this moment just as the factions had made their break for it Osiris would make 
his way to the reef the final part of a plan put in motion long ago was coming into Focus soon all 
would be revealed and soon all would be clear and it would start with the meeting of two monarchs 
and a bargain that would change their fate Osiris had been one of our most critical allies 
in the last few years and even though he had lost his light in the last year itself he had 
been critical to the events that had happened recently and his influence meant that it was 
hard for us to immediately call him a traitor but his actions spoke of such a moment and 
so we had to pursue him with the objective of bringing him to Justice Lakshmi had opened the 
portal into the Vex Network at his Direction the entire city had been put at risk because of his 
choices he needed to answer for what he had done so along with Saint 14 and Crow we converged 
on the reef and discovered that it was once again in turmoil even as Osiris had arrived 
so something there was drawing the forces and eye of zeor Wrath something that was driving 
them mad they were hunting in Earnest perhaps for Osiris zeu had also seemingly taken control 
of the taken themselves who previously had been under savathun's influence the pieces were slowly 
starting to fall into place but what had truly happened would only become clear in the moments 
that followed us discovering Osiris's location when we found him he was conversing with a long 
lost figure Queen Mara she had been rescued by a new coven of teans that pet renge had put together 
at Great political expense Mara was conversing with Osiris who was now seemingly filled with an 
unfamiliar guile as we demanded that he surrender himself and that he would be shown Mercy the 
Shadows crept in and and he began to transform before any foul Darkness could truly seep in Mara 
contained The Entity that emerged from Osiris in a crystalline prison and the horror of what had 
happened had suddenly become clear as day Osiris had been possessed by the witch Queen savathun she 
was within him puppeting his body controlling his mind making his every move ever since the death 
of his ghost he had been vulnerable and as he had cowered and hidden from the high celebrant on the 
moon a new Force had discovered him crept in and taken control of his now vulnerable mind savathun 
had been by our side for the last year in secret she had helped us defeat zeu orth's High celebrant 
she had aided us in our plan to force Kyle's hand into an Armistice she had shephered Crow on his 
journey to becoming a guardian alongside us and she had even worked to place the elix in our 
walls to manipulate Lakshmi so that she could be removed from the picture and to engage the Vex 
and create the endless night but now contained in this crystalline prison she had struck a deal 
with Mara sov Osiris would be released back to us and he would be alive only if we could find a 
way to release release savathun from her worm as part of their pact with the worm Gods long ago 
all Hive consumed these symbiot worms they were granted immortality by them but it would require 
a continual tithe of terrible violence and bound The Hive in Eternal service to the darker forces 
behind the worm Gods zavon wanted to be liberated of that tithe the tithe that linked her to the 
witness begrudgingly we were forced to accept sa 14 was outraged of course but he had little choice 
in the matter either this was the only way for him to get his partner back and so he had to work 
alongside the awoken to free the witch of her worm to separate savathun from her worm marov 
would need her newly assembled coven of teans to be restored they had recovered her from the 
ascendant plane but in the process of reaching back to the dreaming City they had had to scatter 
themselves along the lay lines now they were actively trying to hide from the forces of the hi 
war god or needed to be purified and brought back into the fold this required us to enter the 
ascendant plain and to light beacons that had led the teans down the path to Mara in doing so we 
would free certain small portions of the ascendant plane from zor wrath's influence and carve into 
it a new shape a shape of safety that the teans might use to find their way home recovering the 
new Tean coven would also help to strengthen the awoken once more these powerful figures might have 
been from a newer generation of less experienced teans but they were still empowered with some of 
the most potent Magics at the awoken disposal it was absolutely imperative that they all 
be brought home if possible Crow's return to The Reef was also a cause of major disruption 
he had still not been told the whole truth of his identity by the Vanguard his reunion with 
his sister marov left nothing but questions he felt as though he should know this person she was 
clearly important for more reasons than just her title but he just couldn't place it marrow would 
see the reality of what had happened as well and to a certain extent she certain ly resented it the 
Vanguard was keeping the truth of Crow's identity from him they had said that it was for his own 
protection for his own good but the Shadows of the man he had once been still clung to him like 
dust to a grave it brought Mara a considerable degree of pain and it also caused pet Revenge 
to put a knife to his throat on at least one occasion Crow did not understand why but he was 
growing more and more resentful of the asymmetry of his situation and wished to understand what he 
had done to cause so much anger and so much hatred one day his patience and his resolve faltered 
savathun had promised that she could Enlighten him as to his past actions it isn't known what 
power allowed her to do this but she might have manipulated an ability of the darkness known as 
deep site in order to feed Crow's memories back to him whatever she did Crow's old memories from 
his time in the life of Aldren sov returned all at once he remembered who he had been and what he had 
done to his people to the Guardians to the city to Cade it was too much for Crow to Bear he fled to 
his vessel and would go into a period of isolation for some time refusing to speak to anyone but 
his ghost the horrors that he had committed the pain that he had inflicted Crow now saw the 
evil that people had understood him for and was ashamed deeply ashamed for the pain that savathun 
had inflicted Mara invoked her power and silenced the witch Queen in her prison up until the moment 
when she would be liberated from her worm there would be no more words out of this deceiver but 
at this point the damage had already been done but Mara was not quite done with us yet we could 
still play our part in the coming ritual and in order to do so there were certain tools of the 
awoken that we could collect and make use of with this end in mind maras sa set us on the path to 
a weapon that better explained her own connection to her resurrected brother the weapon was known 
as aga's scepter a powerful tool that could carve away paths within the ascendant plane to fulfill 
one's own desires it was initially meant for alren but it was passed on to us Mara told us the story 
behind this weapon a story of arus scepter and R's Crown an analogy for herself and Aldren herself 
and Crow she had explained that across the Gulf of space and time they were cosmically linked 
their hearts beat as one and they could sense each other's presence from far off places but the 
brother she had known the brother she had seen as a tool to be used at her discretion was now gone 
now she would have to rebuild her relationship with a new person with Crow and she would have 
to prove that she could change that she could show Crow the respect he was owed after months of 
preparation the time eventually came zor's forces were claing at the edge of awoken territory and 
it was finally time to extract s aun's worm the ritual would pit all of Zeus's forces against the 
combined might of the Guardians and the Corsair of the reef we succeeded in drawing out savathun's 
worm after defeating many of Zeus's Champions but before she could be ended by Mara sov the 
witch Queen escaped true to her word Osiris was left with us and he was technically unharmed but 
he was also locked into a deep coma and he would be unresponsive for months as he tossed and turned 
fighting against the visions of the witch Queen's mind trying to uncover and unmask what Secrets 
within it that he could but with Osiris having been liberated and with her actions having caused 
us significant ey our next task was a simple one we were to pursue the witch Queen and take revenge 
against her we also knew that now she was a weakened monarch without her worm she was Mortal 
she would have only one life if she died it was all over so our Pursuit was even more desperate 
and so in time we would pursue her to the heart of her dominion and though we expected to find 
a place of Darkness there what we discovered would change everything we thought we knew about 
Darkness and Light savathun's plans were in motion and there was little we could do to stop them now it would not take long for seun's forces 
to reemerge but it was unexpected for them to reemerge above Mars of all places a planet which 
had only recently been stolen by the witness now Mars was back and with even the faintest word of 
its return reaching the hidden ears many agents within that order under ior's command converged 
upon the red planet AIS mourn amongst their number it wouldn't take them long to discover something 
they couldn't easily explain a mysterious relic of the pyramids had been found on Mars it was 
brimming with paracausal potential and the powers of Darkness as iora landed to investigate 
The Relic kitle cabal also arrived and began assembling artillery with lightning speed but they 
weren't here to fight for whatever this pyramid Relic was their Quarry quickly revealed itself 
a massive Hive vessel savathun's Flagship The Lure we were dispatched to Mars with all haste 
and discovered that the planet was covered in temporal anomalies walking through these strange 
Rifts we would get a glimpse into the Martian past more pressingly there was now a large force of 
cabal we needed to bypass to reach savathun we unfortunately had to dispatch of them before 
we boarded The Vessel but when we did board it something was clearly wrong The Hive on this ship 
was surrounded by moths moths filled with light in a certain sense this wasn't so unusual moths 
generally do accompany The Hive and are found in places of death but for them to be full of light 
was strange normally The Hive would exploit or devour light but for these living creatures to 
persist and seemingly Shield The Hive themselves it was strange they were not things of Darkness 
clearly and yet they clung to The Hive in all of their evil something didn't make sense there 
was only one true remnant of Darkness within the vessel that we discovered an artifact of 
the black Fleet at the foot of a half-destroyed statue we wouldn't know it at the time but this 
half-destroyed statue was a statue of the first disciple of the witness rol and the artifact that 
we had retrieved from beneath it was supposed to be a gift for savathun should she ever ascend to 
the rank of a disciple a gift that now she would never receive as we would soon discover when we 
reached the heart of the vessel we found a portal into savathun's Throne world and saw the witch 
Queen retreating through but we would make an even more distressing Discovery as we approached 
a knight of remarkable strength and size emerged from the portal but stranger still there was 
a ghost at his side and when we felt him once the ghost resurrected him and he began to use 
the powers of the light just like a Titan would have this would be the first time in our history 
that we would face off against a hive guardian and unfortunately it would not be the last we 
would have to become very accustomed to the practice of crushing The Hive ghosts so that they 
could not resurrect their charges but after this moment our initial assumption was rather clear 
for these ter terrible things to have happened savathun must surely have found a way to steal 
the light somehow so we pursued her into her throne world and discovered the extent of her use 
of the light instead of being a terrible place of Darkness like the throne worlds of croa and orx 
her throne was different it was filled with light this place wasn't home to a typical Hive brood 
either these were the Lucent Hive savathun's own brood that were also reflected in the light's 
luminous Sheen they were using the light as a weapon against us their Guardians were formidable 
but so was savathun quickly we caught up with her and we thought we had momentarily defeated her but 
of course it was far too simple merely a deceptive echo which quickly subdued us and cast us out of 
the throne world we were left abandoned on the Sands of mar by The Relic and so we returned to 
it where iora was standing there waiting for us we reported our initial findings to iora and took 
the artifact we had discovered to the nearby Relic itself it then began to react to us and granted us 
a new power of Darkness known as deep site using deep site we were able to reveal the psychic 
Echoes surrounding certain objects or people this allowed glimpses into their pasts and into 
their minds it could also be used by The Relic to adjust weapons rewriting them as if pulling them 
from another time or from a memory of something that they could have been a relic of power such 
as this combined with the artifact recovered from savathun's ship could create something remarkable 
and under the scrutiny of The Relic the artifact changed it created something new a glaive the 
Enigma a weapon that had been intended for savathun a weapon whose designs and specifications 
dated back to a culture that had been destroyed eons before the hive or Humanity this was an 
original design of the luans one that rol had been fond of one of the only legacies of his home world 
to have survived with our new weapon in hand aora instructed us to make further EXP incursions into 
the throne world we had to discover how savathun had stolen the light at all costs and now we had 
a new power at our disposal with deep site maybe we could use it to understand more about what 
had happened not long into our incursion we encountered an unlikely Ally a Defector of sorts 
his name was Finch and he was one of the ghosts of the Lucent Hive who had decided not to resurrect 
his Guardian after a certain amount of time getting to know him his Guardian just so happened 
to be a hive Knight whose body Finch could always be found loitering by Finch made a quick 
diplomatic request for safety and cooperation in order to assure that he would survive he would 
assist the Guardians in their investigation and do his best to understand how savathun had 
stolen the light whilst our ghost wasn't initially trusting a finch he more than proved 
himself as time progressed he first informed us that if we wanted Clues we might want to start 
with seira's Ghost Shell savathun had stolen it when she abducted Osiris and it was still in her 
possession located in a temple somewhere within the throne World currently it represented one of 
our only Clues as to how she had gone about with her theft of the light it was at this point that 
we also discovered that the scorn had entered the throne World their presence here was an enigma 
one seemingly unexplained at first we thought thought it might be FAL The Fanatic commanding 
them to encounter and Conquer new lands but this wasn't the case bch quickly explained that with 
savathun's light in the throne World there would need to be a more powerful overriding force 
of Darkness to counter and control them a counterbalancing force couldn't possibly be fical 
savathun's light was simply too powerful this was our first hint at the Menace that we would later 
face this and the looming pyramid far off in the distance when we discovered sagira's shell it 
was found in a ruined Temple to savathun's Sister Zorra The Hive God of War when we grabbed it we 
heard a brief psychic echo of savathun it stated that she had stood before an ancient being with 
a thousand names she would name one of them the witness this was the first time our Guardians 
had heard of the ancient fo's identity the ancient foe that had brought about our collapse 
the same foe that commanded the black Fleet and that had reached out to tempt us with stasis 
we didn't know it at the time but we had just unmasked savathun's greatest enemy and Humanity's 
most ancient foe but aside from this one psychic Echo the shell was inert and we would need more 
clues to continue our investigation but thanks to good sleuthing we quickly discovered a new 
location deep in savathun's Throne World hidden to all but the keenest of eyes a place known as 
the altar of reflection amplifying our powers of deep site here allowed us to tap into the psychic 
Echoes of seira's shell more closely and we heard more context from the words of savathun that had 
manifested around sagira's shell we learned that she had used Osiris's form to get close to us 
and learn more about the nature of the light it felt like our investigations were starting to 
bear fruit and so we continued to search for more objects to interact with our deep sight was now 
the key to our investigation leveraging its power of insight we would be able to see what was going 
on with the past of any object that we recovered from the throne World taking it to the altar of 
reflection allowed us to Glimpse what had been and unveil more of savathun's plans eager to prove his 
worth Finch quickly found another lead for us on an object that might help us dis conern savathun's 
plans and it most certainly was a compelling lead a Temple dedicated to oric guarded by alakul 
the former dark blade who had now been reborn in the light was supposedly housing an object 
of incredible power that savathun had stolen from or's dreadn unfortunately for the guardian of 
this Sanctuary alak hul the long awaited rematch between us and him ended much the same way as the 
first encounter did and within the loosened Temple of the Navigator he was struck down once more and 
as it turned out the temple did indeed contain a powerful artifact from or's past a tablet of 
Ruin one of or's ancient records in which he recorded the secrets he stole from ARA the secret 
behind the power to take returning the tablet of Ruin to the altar of reflection showed us more of 
or's power to take it told us that this power was the power to move things between dimensions and 
that the witness also had this power the psychic echo of savathun proclaimed her plan that 
she would use this power not to take but to save she would hide the traveler away in her own 
Throne world and seal it away so that she could keep it safe and keep it for herself this meant 
that the urgency of the stakes was starting to become even more clear we needed more leads fin 
made another educated guess he stated that there might be another clue hidden in a third Temple 
this time instead of being dedicated to one of savathun's siblings this was a Temple dedicated 
to savathun herself or rather her younger self sathona we raided this Temple and discovered a 
worm familiar on a statue that represented the younger version of the witch queen as it turned 
out this wasn't some Effigy of a worm familiar it was the original worm familiar the one that had 
been sent by rol to the osmium King the one that had whispered to savathun and the osmium king of 
a terrible Calamity that would be written in the stars of the godwave this was the thing that had 
whispered to savathun and convinced her and her sisters to go down into the deep this was the 
reason that the hive existed the original mover in a plan set in motion long ago but this worm 
was well guarded we had to fight our way through an illusion of an aramara whose might was palpable 
and whose strength and reinforcements were quickly descending Upon Us escaping from out of the Temple 
of the cunning we were able to make our way back to the altar of reflection but this time when 
we approached with the worm something barred our access to it immediately we couldn't even enter 
the altar our only lead had suddenly turned into a dead end Aur believed that she had grown tunnel 
visioned in the investigation and took a moment to distance herself from the search thanks to Growing 
pressure from Zavala his belligerence certainly didn't help he wasn't keen on the idea of us using 
deep site either given that it was yet another illicit use of a power of Darkness this didn't 
stop him from fully accepting what Eris mour said though as one of our foremost experts in the power 
of Darkness she was ready to assist us in our next steps she had discovered something something 
that would unstick our investigation deep in savathun's Apothecary Wing one of her High counil 
Wizards held A Shard of Crystal this Crystal Shard had been from the prison that Mara sov had placed 
savathun into only half a year ago the same prison that she had communed with us from the same Prison 
from which she had dislodged uldren's memory into Crow's mind we rushed to retrieve The Shard and 
despite Fierce resistance we were able to retrieve it the forces there included savathun's right hand 
one of her High Council wizards but even she was not enough to stop us this time as we brought the 
crystal Shard to the altar of reflection we were granted Ingress and a shocking truth was revealed 
to us through the use of our deep site we saw the moment after savathun had been freed from her worm 
and we saw that she transported herself to a cliff side near the last City breaking out of the 
prison had left her mortally wounded and with no worm her immortality was gone she pulled The 
Shard of Crystal from her side and knelt on the cliff side in the sight of the traveler speaking 
to it espousing the possibility that it had been clever enough to deceive her and allow her to 
Simply die and then she did we witnessed her final death clawing and beating at the edges 
of reality she simply passed away there was no climactic final battle there was no death at 
the hands of a great warrior she simply faded and then a ghost appeared IM Maru he had found 
savathun's corpse and as ghosts do he scanned it more shocking still he deemed her worthy of the 
Traveler's light to say that this newfound truth would Shake us to our core is an understatement 
savathun as it turns out had never stolen the light it had been willingly given to her by The 
Traveler The Hive was some of the Traveler's most ancient enemies they had committed countless 
atrocities against humanity and the elix they had persistently hunted the traveler with the 
desire to consume its life height and yet one of the greatest foes The Traveler had ever known 
had been chosen and had been deemed worthy as if this Revelation wasn't shocking enough savathun 
herself quickly made an appearance within the altars of reflection she had been watching us the 
whole time and she had gained a crucial Insight thanks to our actions it's worth remembering 
that savathun died and was Reborn born as a guardian Guardians have no memories of their past 
lives but within savathun's Throne world she has a unique degree of insight and can see all things 
that happen with this in mind savathun was able to watch our every single move within the altar of 
reflection she didn't remember her plan she had made it long ago in her past life but now we 
had fed that same plan back to her she didn't need need to remember it we had remembered it for 
her and suddenly it was clear that this was all a trap laid for us by the witch Queen all along 
we were meant to follow her we were meant to find the relic of the black Fleet within her ship 
we were meant to bring it to the Relic and craft the Enigma discovering deep site we were meant to 
find siga's Shell and the tablet of Ruin and the Crystal Shard we were meant to feed savathun's 
plan back to her and we had done exactly that now she knew exactly what she intended to do she 
would abduct the traveler seal her throne world and cut us off from the light for good we were 
promptly ejected from the altar of reflection we had failed savathun had her plan in place now it 
was only a matter of time we had been porns in it all along but aora in this moment had some resolve 
despite the supposed treachery of the traveler she would go on and keep fighting for the people 
of the last City the ones that she had sworn to protect even if the traveler had betrayed us 
it didn't matter we would still use the light to defend Humanity that was our purpose after all 
and besides there was one remaining lead in this investigation the worm familiar we had still not 
been able to read it via the altars of reflection but the altar wasn't the only way to access deep 
site we had originally found it from The Relic on Mars and so iora took the familiar to The Relic 
and used Darkness via deep sight to discern the worms Secrets it was here that she saw the truth 
never told in the books of sorrow or the world's grave or any ancient histories of the hive 
the worm familiar contained a psychic Echo of the words of the witness itself it was 
speaking to its first disciple rol and we heard the words of its plan exposed it would tell 
the most cunning of the three siblings of a coming cataclysm it would force them to go down into 
the deep it would force them to take the pact of the worms and to become the hive but there 
would be no godwave there would be no cataclysm savathun might have been the god of deception 
but the witness had lied to The Hive all along this was a small piece of information relative 
to the coming Calamity that savathun was about to bring but it was crucial nonetheless it was 
perhaps the only break in savathun's armor that we could find there was little more we could do 
now we simply had to return to savathun's throne world and confront her once and for all and when 
we arrived we saw that she had already begun her ritual The Traveler had begun to manifest in the 
skies above the throne world if we didn't hurry the throne world would be sealed and the traveler 
would be stuck here forever so we raced to the Pinnacle of savathun's Throne World bringing the 
worm familiar with us when we entered savathun's ritual space and attempted to dislodge her 
progress we realized that the alterate its Center was deep site compatible it could show savathun 
the truth of the deception played upon her her by the witness and so we placed the worm familiar 
upon it the truth confused and then enraged the witch Queen it made her Reckless this weakness was 
just enough it exposed the witch Queen savathun had always believed herself to be superior but now 
she was rattled at the apex of the throne World in a great battle of light against light we fought 
with the witch Queen savathun and despite all the odds stacked against us despite savathun's 
ancient and unknown Powers despite her having won in the Battle of lies and deception she fell 
we were victorious but in her moment of defeat savathun warned us that we had only succeeded 
in leaving the traveler vulnerable she told us that the witness was returning and that the game 
was ours to play now win or lose before before we could crush her ghost yaru a great beam of light 
appeared from above the traveler had left and was returned to the last City and in this bright 
shining light imaru disappeared as well the hidden would come to collect savathun's remains 
for study and we had a new objective savathun had given us the final warning we needed our foe was 
unmasked the witness we needed to learn more of it we needed to prepare for it we would need to face 
it and defeat it for ourselves we weren't done in the throne World either we learned more of the 
witness from marov who intended to discover more about it via savathun's worm it had been there 
during the entirety of savathun's life and had witnessed the collapse those crucial moments 
where the witness's forces had been defeated as is seemingly Tradition at this point we would 
end up weaponizing this creature on our path to restoring it and it would begrudgingly inform us 
that savathun had played a key role in preventing the witness from completely destroying Us in 
the collapse it wouldn't be some time before we learned what that effort was but we did discover 
that it was savathun's actions of killing nzar and stealing the veil thus preventing the witness from 
enacting the final shape but the greatest mystery of the throne world was one that was yet to 
reveal itself there was a pyramid far off in the distance its influence had begun to corrupt 
savathun's Throne World visibly whilst her core structures were still cast in a Lucent Sheen the 
further away from the heart of savathun's Throne world the one ventured the more it was visible 
that the pyramid's corruption was seeping outward eventually savathun's own structures fell into 
to Decay and an entirely new kind of architecture arose ancient pyramid complexes the architecture 
of the black Fleet this was no coincidence this was the vessel of the first disciple of the 
witness rol he had been cursed by savathun when she had taken the light but even though 
the curse had sunken rol's pyramid vessel into the bog it couldn't prevent rol from exercising 
his power he was still sending out his forces namely the scorn we had encountered throughout 
our journey into savathun's Throne World proper her forces were losing a ground war against his 
and we still didn't know of his existence until we investigated the pyramid for ourselves that 
was where we first heard the words of the first disciple of the witness he saw our power and had 
seen that we had defeated the witch Queen and so he invited us into his pyramid and to either 
accept the gifts of the witness or to fall as its enemies to be subjugated to rise from the deep or 
drown within it we pursued the first disciple of the witness Into the Heart of his own vessel and 
at each turn we were offered power but we spurned it we destroyed his caretaker we undid his dark 
offerings and we traed through his many vessels that he had collected from Saul in the end despite 
our efforts rul had seen the supposed measure of our power and deemed us unfit to join the witness 
we had been the defiant and as was seemingly tradition in R's eyes there was nothing more for 
us to be except crushed to this end he deployed his Ultimate Weapon the upended a super weapon 
powered by the mother of the worm Gods seated who still lay within R's pyramid as his captive 
the exact function of this weapon was unknown but it could supposedly turn worlds upside down 
and was powerful enough to seal savathun's Throne World from the light rendering us helpless and so 
we sped on to confront the disciple and pushed to destroy him with all haste rol was by far the 
most powerful being we had faced up until this point his power eclipsed both that of orex and 
savathun his command of Darkness was unyielding but rol had one weakness arrogance he stroe across 
the battlefield not as a great destroyer and a conqueror but as one who is watching seeing us 
claw our way towards Victory as an entertainment he underestimated us and his hubris would be his 
undoing by our combined power of light and dark by the time we had dealt the mortal blow rol realized 
it was too late his last words faithful even in his dying breath were a plea to the witness for 
forgiveness and thus the first disciple fell thus did we prove that the witness's forces were not 
unassailable and that they would not conquer us so easily we had dealt the first serious blow to 
our enemies it would not be the last the war had just begun but back on Earth we had other issues 
to deal with savathun might have been defeated but her forces and her brood were running rampant 
across the system and were harvesting the light from the last City's Guardians fledgling Guardians 
in particular who were not powerful enough to fend off these newcomers of equal station we first 
leared of this thanks to a rather confrontational convers ation in the tower Hangar One between Lord 
Saladin and kitle our earlier actions on Mars at the very beginning of the conflict involved us 
killing some of her Advanced forces they had fired upon us first and so kitle agreed to forgive the 
transgression but once this would be something she would never repeat true to her word Zavala seized 
Upon This Moment of diplomacy and proposed a joint action of sorts an Allied St strike against the 
enemy of Kit's enemy Against The Hive Guardians using her Scion forces kitle would help us 
to secure Hive Guardians within a mindscape we would then enter their own psyches and render 
them effectively brain dead by destroying their inner selves in this state their minds could be 
scrubbed for intelligence by the Scions and their plans could eventually be deduced Crow immediately 
took issue with the plan believing that it wasn't right to put even monsters through such torment he 
had once been seen by everyone as a monster and he saw that the way we treated our enemies had an 
important impact on the way that we treated each other as well saladan would temper his beliefs 
by saying that whilst Mercy was important Mercy for one's foes shouldn't come at the cost of 
Mercy to one's allies but at the time Crow didn't listen rejecting this wisdom would have 
grave conse quences eventually we discovered what the hive's plan was they were gathering light 
above the Scarlet keep and were intending to use the keep as an amplifier for a ritual this 
ritual would have manifested savathun's Throne world above Earth on the moon this would have 
allowed them to engage in a direct assault on Earth and would have let them take the traveler 
if we did not stopped them immediately together with Kyle's forces we confronted these Hive 
and destroyed destroyed their Commander before they could finish the ritual Crow had been 
unresponsive during this operation and the reason why would soon hit us like a ton of bricks 
when nobody was watching Crow had returned to the command carrier that the Vanguard was using parked 
within the last City the helm it was here that one of Kyle's Scion opuses was scrubbing through the 
minds of the various captured Hive in this moment Crow followed his convictions and did what he 
believed was right disconnecting the Scion from the captured Hive this would allow the hive to 
finally rest as they were no longer in a state of limbo but unfortunately in doing so the Sion 
who was connected to the hive was also killed Crow lamented his error but Saladin quickly arrived on 
the scene and chastised him for his foolishness kitle would not so easily forgive this mistake 
we had already been offered Mercy once for our own transgressions Crow would need to face the 
consequences of his actions with cabal Justice in mind when Crow confessed his error to kitle 
she demanded that he take responsibility a life for a life was her way and Crow's life would 
be forfeit for his actions but Saladin in a moment of fearless sacrifice stepped forth before 
kitle and said that he would honor her he forfeit his own life in place of crows bravery like this 
was something to be celebrated in the eyes of the cabal Saladin had offered his own life in a form 
of payment and whilst it would have been tradition for him to die there was something else that could 
have been done kitle could finally achieve what she had always wanted a lightbearer on her war 
council and so she decided to conduct a different form of Justice saladin's life from that moment 
would be forfeit but it wouldn't mean his death instead she demanded Justice in the form of a 
lifetime of service from Lord Saladin he would become her brus and he would serve her Faithfully 
on the war council of her Empire until the end of his days this was something which was quickly 
agreed to by Zavala who even told Crow not to say a word humanity and the cabal had been close 
in this moment to allout war we weren't just going to allow Crow to die saladin's moment of absolute 
bravery had saved diplomatic relations between the cabal and Humanity by preventing an allout War 
even better it had brought the two peoples closer now the two were interlined a guardian on Kittle's 
war council would also be able to represent us and to put our interests into the cabal's 
considerations even as many cabal would protest test the appointment Saladin would need to prove 
himself he did so in the way of the cabal through the rights of proving when there were some who 
came to challenge him he defeated every Challenger and within the space of less than a week was 
promoted from braas to valis thus the newly anointed valis Forge would be one of Kittle's 
greatest warriors and was appointed command of his own cabal Legions the legion under his command 
would be trained in a different manner than those typically seen in the cabal Empire Saladin would 
call them his iron War beasts his personal guard and he would use his hundreds of years of training 
to create an elite fighting force amongst their ranks thanks to Bravery here kitle and Humanity 
would see closer cooperation in the months to come and this would be important other forces were 
moving in the system the witness would quickly look to replace its first dis Le there would 
be one obvious Contender one who had already willingly offered himself up and his Ascension 
would be the next priority of the black Fleet our close alliance with the cabal and the other 
forces within the system would morph into a wider Cooperative Force as time went on the elix of 
the House of light and the awoken of the reef would join Kittle's ascendancy and the Guardians 
of the Vanguard to form what would be known as the Coalition together we would stand as the 
last Bull workk against the witness and it's desire to impose the final shape upon the 
universe the first test for this fledgling Alliance would arrive soon above Luna in the form 
of the Leviathan it had previously disappeared after the black Fleet had taken our worlds but now 
it had returned but instead of the opulent gold trimmings and white marble that it had once had it 
was infested with the same aggor fungus that we'd found on board the GL worse still the Leviathan 
was attempting to forge a link a link between its own systems and those of the Pyramid of Luna 
that awaited below all this was being done at the direction of Emperor callus and he was making 
these preparations in order to begin his Ascension into a disciple of the witness he needed to bind 
himself and his mind to the Pyramid of Luna his success would Grant him incredible power but a 
failure in this regard might bias time Nightmares From The Pyramid began to entrench themselves 
aboard the Leviathan as the energies of the two vessels began to merge members of our Coalition 
would be closely and personally targeted as we attempted to board the Leviathan and stop Emperor 
callus some amongst our number like Aur Ray would stay away from this threat her nightmare wore a 
painful face the face of Cade 6 others had to face Their Fear though and would go to Aris to seek 
out Her counsel much to their disappointment the only way to solve this problem would be painful 
she would use her magic to bind them together in a ritual with the crown of Sorrow by binding 
our nightmares to the crown we would be able to pass into the deepest parts of the Leviathan 
and would be protected from the nightmares the crown could also be used to contain and release 
these nightmares in conjunction with a device of eris's making the nightmare Harvester a wicked 
contraption that would direct the torment of our foes and allow us to control the forces of nz's 
waking vessel dominating them in the same way that they had dominated us manifestations of fear would 
no longer stop us despite our Newfound Alliance Empress kaisel would initially reject taking part 
in any such ceremony calling into question eris's witchcraft as a danger to the cause after all 
Toro Bartel had fallen because of Hive sorcery and it was a predictable thing that the empress 
would be less than pleased with eris's solution considering what had happened to galran previously 
on the Leviathan too many cabal had already been lost by meddling in Hive sorcery but the rest 
of us who had spent a significant amount of time around Aris fighted off the hive gods and delving 
into the occult understood that this was our best chance and so we entered into the binding ritual 
alongside Crow and Commander zala each of them would be haunted by unique nightmares nightmares 
that would tear at their psyche and give them the greatest reminders possible of the pain of their 
past Crow would be haunted by an all too familiar nightmare a nightmare of his former self alren s 
it taunted him across the Leviathan and was quick to remind him of all the evil he had done in his 
past life of all the pain he had inflicted he was reminded of the deaths of the awoken of the Barons 
he had Unleashed upon the reef and of the murder of Cade which had harmed so many people he'd come 
to love only by facing his shame and understanding that he could use these experiences to become 
a better man would Crow find peace Zavala was haunted by grief a grief that had been born of 
a long lost part of his past of his wife sfia he had been driven to grief so deep that its extent 
is hard to Fathom he had failed to protect their adopted son hakeim back in the Dark Ages during 
the middle of his training as an iron Lord he had left saladin's tutelage specifically to start a 
family with hakeim and safia But ultimately the failure to protect his son had haunted him for the 
rest of his days and he would continually ask his wife for her forgiveness but there was nothing to 
forgive even as he kept asking ultimately they had to separate something that drove pain even deeper 
Sophia remarried and had a daughter and when Sophia passed her family line each generation 
would see Zavala visiting them he continued to ask for forgiveness an unending torment folding 
itself inward down the generations the commander had asked forgiveness so many times that the 
torment was perhaps built in a grief and sorrow that we can't fathom ultimately the only person 
the commander needed to forgive was was himself and in doing so he was able to press forward 
both Crow and Zavala had many challenges to face but they would press forward and they both 
conquered their nightmares they were manifested things of Darkness but they were not necessarily 
evil the nightmares that they were turned instead to Memories positive manifestations of Darkness 
that could remind them of the nature of Their Own Strength of the trials they had conquered and 
of how far they had come of what they had learned but they were not alone a third member of their 
Cadre needed to confront their own nightmares and of course it was kitle her nightmare manifested as 
the form of Dominus Gaul he was a role model that kitle had long looked up to but she also knew that 
his ways were insufficient for the times at hand the cabal needed to change but kitle was overtaken 
with the burden of her responsibility and with her failure to defend her home world she was 
defenseless against the nightmares but Aris would eventually convince her to join the Guardians in 
The Binding ritual and so we were able to help her in her next attempt to banish the nightmare when 
she faced Gaul again it was with renewed strength and with a greater resolve understanding that his 
ways were the ways of the past and that her ways could chart a better future for the cabal one not 
of her father's greed or of gaul's brutality but her own way a way of Honor cooperation diplomacy 
and alliances a new cabal that would grow beyond their previous reputation and their restrictive 
past with the nightmares turned into memories we were all guarded against Call's defenses it 
would soon be time to infiltrate the heart of the Leviathan but there were other avenues for us 
to investigate in the meantime in her searches of the inner parts of the Leviathan Aris MN had 
discovered the old tribute Hall that callus had dedicated to us there she had found a statue 
within which there was a thread of Call's mind she had ens snared that thread and crafted a ritual 
that would allow us to infiltrate deep into the inner reaches of Call's own psyche using this we 
would understand Call's motivations better as well as his weaknesses and so the Mind Heist began but 
what we saw was that Call's mind had been clefted in two there was a duality in his soul on one hand 
there was a side of him that was being tortured by the past and by the people who he had loved or 
who he had thought he had been betrayed by on the other hand there was a dark and reverent fervor 
that would would lead him to being exalted as one of the witness's disciples purpose and regret sat 
side by side in Call's mind but at the heart of it all beyond the midnight coup's conspirators Beyond 
galran and cis's failure to Marshall The Hive there was a greater shame at the heart of it all 
we learned that Call's greatest shame was also his greatest love his daughter kitle she had been his 
betrayer and ultimately it would be the thing that wounded him the most he knew that he had failed 
her as a father even though he believed that he had tried it would haunt him more prominently 
than any nightmare we had faced even to his final moments he would think of kitle and think of his 
failure armed with this knowledge and protected against the nightmares of the pyramid we ventured 
back into the deepest parts of the Leviathan and fought to Infiltrate The Heart Of The Vessel 
and to stop callus before he could merge with the pyramid we would be drawn into the pyramid 
vessel itself in the process and alongside kitle we would face down the nightmares we had fought 
once again but this time instead of being forced to retreat we were victorious in breaking them 
we also unded Call's connection to the pyramid preventing his more immediate Transfiguration 
into a great disciple of the witness kital took one last moment to mourn the father that she had 
known there was nothing left of him who he was now was lost to the witness the father that she would 
inevitably need to kill was not the same as the man that at one point she had loved as a father 
Zavala and Crow took a moment to say farewell to the manifested memories of alren and Sofia their 
pasts had been put behind them and though it took time for the scars to heal they were taking 
their first steps within the deepest reaches of the Pyramid of Luna we stood Victorious broken 
beaten Reckoning with our past but still alive still United the strength of the Coalition had 
held and soon it would be tested once more nazar's presence would begin to grow louder and louder and 
soon our other allies would be called to hunt down those Echo until they could at last be reunited 
and an all too familiar villain awoke from the ice after the nightmares of the Leviathan 
had been quelled a surge of activity began on Europa Aramis had been released 
from her icy tomb by the witness it had demanded a task of her and expected success 
without delay it was her dark master now the freedom that she had sought for the house 
of Salvation was nothing but an illusion she would be forced to Rally her forces in the 
witness's name and now she would serve its dark purpose it showed her a series of relics relics 
that Aramis recognized many had been claimed in the past of the elix during the great days 
of the pirate Cruise her task was simple collect them the punishment for failure would be 
severe aramus would get to her feet and would re Unite with some of her oldest allies her pirating 
Crews the old liix Pirate Legends of the system would flock to her CES the ship stealer was on 
the move once again and as both ship stealer of the devils and Kell of Salvation she would 
find these relics for the witness the hunt was on but for us this hunt would begin with a favor 
for The Drifter aramis's Pirates had intercepted one of his shipments and The Drifter had asked us 
to kindly retrieve it as it turned out it was the spider HED up in a containment pod the spider had 
decided in the recent years that it was time to go to ground especially considering that marov did 
not take kindly to the way that he had treated Crow during his time of occupation with the spider 
and so in order to avoid Mara's wroth Drifter and the spider had cut a deal the The Drifter would 
smuggle him out and the spider just needed to sit tight now spider told us that if we were to get 
him out we would need to Commander his old catch and exfiltrate him spider had overheard a few of 
house salvation's drags talking about the new goal that the house had been set by their Kell now we 
knew that we needed to search for these artifacts in order to keep them out of aramis's hands riding 
out on the catch we returned to the last City with our crew spider would now be under the protection 
of the House of light answering to his new Kell mythrax who he seemed to have a strange degree 
of familiarity with and so the spider Drifter and ourselves would unite alongside Ido and mithrax 
together this mly crew of lightbearers and elix would search for the relics and attempt to secure 
them for the Coalition Ido was a relatively new arrival in our eyes we had briefly spoken with 
her during the time of the Endless night but now we would meet mithrax as adopted daughter 
firsthand she was more than simply mythra's daughter though she was the Scribe of the House 
of light and a competent one at that her curiosity was something that would consistently guide her 
on Expeditions and whilst it would sometimes put her in danger it was also an incredible Boon 
allowing her to uncover secrets that few others had ever thought possible to exist she would 
be responsible for researching the nature of the relics that we were trying to uncover mithrax 
was uneasy being around these old Crews and was also uneasy being around the relics that we were 
collecting there was indeed a terrible Darkness to these relics but there was something more to 
mythra's fear familiarity it was relatively clear that mithrax had interacted with these relics 
at some point in his past but the true nature of his connection to them wouldn't be revealed 
to us just yet the relics were scattered across the system but they each contained a dark power 
that made them valuable items to possess they had universally fallen into the hands of various 
pirate Warlords and Smugglers and we consistently raced Aramis to each one of them when they were 
located often beating her to the punch by only a matter of moments Gathering more and more of 
these relics to our side only made mythrax more and more uneasy and eventually idido's curiosity 
was peaked by a transmission from Aramis she made contact with Ido and mithrax and demanded to 
Parlay with us on neutral ground she made this request in keeping with old elix Customs her honor 
was at stake should she break the contract and so all approached with the idea of peace and parlay 
in mind but the words that Aramis spoke would be her true weapons of war and she would use them to 
drive a wedge between mithrax and his daughter she would reveal the truth of mythra's past and why 
he held the relics in such fearful regard as it turned out long ago mythra's mother had done 
the unthinkable she and her Crews had been on the moon and had narrowly escaped death by 
The Hive as she had entered the Pyramid of Luna nar's pyramid within the vessel which had invited 
them in she found nar's body sensing The Power Within it she and her other crew members dissected 
the body of the Dead disciple these pieces were distributed amongst the pirate Crews and from 
them they drew dark and terrible power mithrax inherited one such Relic one of nazar's talents 
perhaps a gift from his mother with its power he had turned into a powerful pirate lord and had 
terrorized the system in his early days elix human awoken it didn't matter he would watch them 
all suffer so that he might get his way the spider had long hinted to this darker version of mythra's 
past and as it turns out the spider and his now deceased brother civix the former leader of the 
Kel's skourge were members of mythra's crew for a Time members that had been exiled by mithrax with 
the truth now revealed Ido was beyond infuriated with her father for not only keeping the truth 
from her but also for the nature of his actions in the past it would not be easy for her to forgive 
him but much as Ido might have understood the knowledge of the past the context of actually 
living it is a different thing The Drifter would try and speak to her his time in the Dark 
Age had shown him the hostility and harshness that the world had unveiled itself to contain and 
he would attempt to get her to empathize with her father's position at the time unfortunately Ido 
was not so easy to trust and The Reckless streak born of her curiosity was only emboldened by the 
discoveries about her father as we recovered more of the relics her Trust might slowly mend but it 
wouldn't quite fully heal in time for what would happen next things came to a head in the battle 
for the final Relic Ido had gone ahead and claimed it personally but Aramis was hot on her Trail as 
were another Force the Lucent Hive their reason for Desiring the remains of nzar was unknown but 
in a somewhat unexpected turn Aramis would defend Ido from the Lucent brood Ido and Aramis were 
technically enemies of different houses but in Ido Aramis had seen hope a new generation 
of elix that might be free of the old rot that clung to herself and mythrax they were both 
relics themselves relics of a generation that had known nothing but war and strife the Betrayal of 
the great machine the darkness of the Whirlwind the terror of the long drift Ido had not been born 
into these times and so she had a chance to live a life for herself to live a life governing the new 
future of the elix a future that could be improved and so the Kell of Darkness defended The Scribe 
of light eventually we arrived on scene and we saw Aramis with her blades drawn and Ido defenseless 
with this mithrax immediately assumed the worst and engaged Aramis in a jewel with the aid of 
his splicer the tricks he came out on top in Easy fashion only idido's words about how Aramis 
had defended her would stay mithrax his hand from dealing a killing blow with a momentary break in 
combat Aramis would flee from Battle and would leave the last of the relics in our possession she 
retreated and knew that whilst we would celebrate our Victory her house would bear the brunt of the 
failure she had just delivered to the witness it does not forgive and it expects results from its 
supplicants its wroth would soon be felt across the entirety of the House of Salvation and zeu 
arra would be the one to bring them their dark Deliverance with all the relics acquired we had 
time to focus our resources on the matter of Peace for a while we helped rebuild the elix quarter in 
the former bodza district and with his people safe mithrax had time to study the relics in safety and 
though he used that Darkness within the relics he channeled them for a power of good proving yet 
again that darkness is not evil but instead is a neutral Force the darkness is a power linked to 
the mind and to memory and mythra's hope was that he could distill that Darkness into a purer form 
with its ability to provoke memory and emotion this pure Essence was distilled into a medicinal 
solution one that would finally give Saint 14 the time to Rouse Osiris from his long Slumber after 
a happy reunion Osiris would tell us of the things that he had gleaned while sleeping during his 
abduction he had seen into savathun's mind just as she had walked in his body and from there secrets 
had been taken he had seen visions of a distant City on Neptune and of a secret that savathun had 
hidden away there long ago Osiris would spend the next few months searching ravenously for answers 
when he did find them it would be in the form of an old Ally who had returned from the brink 
of death it was time for anaba's work to pay off it was time for the warmind Rasputin to arise 
one last time in the defense of humanity [Music] Anna Bray had been working on Rasputin's systems 
for months now Osiris's return had prompted her to redouble her efforts given that only Rasputin 
could seemingly verify the existence of a hidden human colon on Neptune despite having a vast 
amount of Rasputin's data saved from the Martian Piller engram the data was still incomplete if we 
were going to successfully reconstruct a war mind we would need the assistance of its other Creator 
this was the assessment of Osiris Clover spray the first would need to be involved in order to 
salvage Rasputin descending upon his complex on Europa we discovered quickly that his position 
was being overrun by The Hive and the Wrath born of zeor Wrath they were quickly pursuing Clovis 
but they had clearly returned to the system in force to accomplish more goals than simply this 
the house of Salvation troops that were fighting alongside Zeus's Hive were also different they 
no longer had their free will they were Zeus's latest wrath born the dark soldiers that had been 
corrupted by her influence and the cryptolith to burned into mindless beasts of War aramis's house 
was being punished and this was not the only way in which that punishment would manifest the return 
of the war God had created another reason to resurrect Rasputin it could be a powerful weapon 
and if its warsat Network could be brought online again it could be used in a decisive manner to 
defeat zeor wrath's forces after saving Clovis from the witnesses forces he agreed to assist Us 
in rebuilding the war mind he arrogantly stated that he would be required for the process as only 
a mind of his singular genius could possibly be trusted to coordinate this herculan task and 
so Anna took a moment to transfer him from his facility on Europa into her prototype exoframe 
where Rasputin was being rebuilt this would allow Clovis to more closely monitor the war mine's 
restoration in order to return Rasputin to life we would need data mountains of it the data needed 
to construct Rasputin once more could be found in his old subes such as Charlamagne and malahayati 
acquiring these old fragments of knowledge would be like finding pieces to a puzzle and slowly we 
would rebuild the war mind some of the war mind's own code would also be able to help us the more 
of it that there was the more Rasputin would be able to reconstruct on his own his heuristics 
would be able to fill in the gaps but even as we embarked on this task Elsie Bray would caution 
us against trusting Clovis too much she had dealt with him plenty of times before and she knew 
that he relied on his manipulative character to get his own way she also knew that his agenda 
was often not to be trusted he was self-serving to the maximum if he was working to re build Rasputin 
there was bound to be a reason for it as we worked to reconstruct the warmind we uncovered yet more 
of its Secrets floating in orbit above the last City there was an orbital platform known as the 
serf station it contained yet more war mined data and also held the possibility to be a command 
station for the warat network should the need arise a powerful asset to secure for sure but 
at the station's heart we saw a terrible sign of what had happened to the house of Salvation 
they had raided the facility for certain but they were not LED purely by elix they were led by 
Hive they were led by rathborne and then the sign of the witness's cruelty could be seen firsthand 
prais the technocrat and elix we had killed back on Europa had been risen by the witness as a 
scorn infused with Darkness his ether had been corrupted and he had become an undead Aramis 
reached out to us in this moment she made it clear that this was the fate of her house and that 
it was a regret that would travel with her for the rest of her days upon securing the station we 
would be able to transfer its control over to Rasputin's systems with more of Rasputin's submind 
architecture restored anab would begin searching further a field for new sources of warmed data she 
stumbled upon a novel and ingenious source of it a ghost specifically the one that had belonged to 
the iron Lord felwinter after all felwinter was intimately connected to the warmind he had been 
one of Rasputin's sedata Golems the spies and the eyes and ears that Rasputin had sent out into the 
population so he might know them Rasputin's data was contained within felwinter and his ghost 
contained some of that data as well we found its remains at the iron Temple and returned 
that data back to the war mind then something remarkable happened felwinter's memories and 
personalities were merged with the war mind giving it New Perspectives and allowing it to emerge and 
speak for itself for the first time it swiftly made contact with us and told us that Clovis Bray 
was not to be trusted that he had deceived us all Rasputin informed us of what clovis's original 
goal for the warind was he told us of how he was meant to strike down the traveler and to 
replace it as Humanity's war God all this was meant to be accomplished with a protocol known 
as abhorent imperative the same protocol that would allow Rasputin to strike the traveler with 
its warad Network Rasputin also informed us that Clovis Bray planned to merge his systems with 
that of the newly reborn warind and to use it to gain control over all of Rasputin's warsat 
network with these weapons at his disposal and being integrated into Rasputin's code Clovis Bray 
planned to ascend and become a mechanical God for Humanity the great leader that would Shepherd 
us into the future the last Universal common ancestor of all human progress Clover Bray as per 
usual simply wanted to be the one in control he had always been a Madman self-obsessed from the 
beginning and this time sadly was no different Anna and Elsie immediately confronted Clovis with 
this knowledge and he quickly was removed from the exoframe and sent back to his original facility 
on Europa in his place the newly resurgent warind would emerge and he would help to guide us to what 
we needed in order to complete the rebuild of his systems Not only would this allow him to better 
unearth the truth of the colony that Osiris had glimpsed in savathun's mind but it would bring 
us one step closer to reactivating the war min's defensive capabilities in full it looked as 
though we might succeed for a bit but soon it became evident that even our best laid plans were 
not going to survive contact with a zivra thanks to some clever deductions by Eris mour and Ido it 
was discovered that zeor wrath was setting a trap for us all the war mind's Revival was something 
she had anticipated and in a spectacular display of her own power zeu was pressing us to rebuild 
the war mind and this is why Hive Gods feed off of their ability to create whatever honors them in 
Zeus's case she is honored by War not simply the act of making War on your enemies of battling them 
but also of the rituals that take place before the maintenance of machines the construction of 
weapons the building of defenses the sharpening of Swords by preparing Rasputin and rebuilding a 
giant machine of War we were effectively engaging in worship of Zorra this would all come to a head 
if the warat network was used they were Rasputin's greatest weapons and so long as they were used in 
an act of War zeu would be honored she would gain enough power to open her portals to her throne 
world above Earth and begin a fullscale Invasion and if it just so happened that zeu claimed the 
warsats for herself then all the better they would be turned on the traveler and it would possibly be 
destroyed if we used our great weapons we lost and if if we let them fall into the hands of the hive 
and the Wrath we would also lose Rasputin made the final tragic calculation in order for us to be 
victorious we had to refuse to play Zeo orth's game in the first place but his final damning 
conclusion on the course of action we needed to take would take a few weeks to properly calculate 
in the meantime there were other strange Rumblings coming from around the system in particular Osiris 
detected an anomaly on Mars we had learned that the scars and temporal anomalies on Mars were 
the result of the witness looking into the past and trying to uncover something Osiris believed 
that it too was searching for the hidden colony in savathun's mind the secret that she had hidden 
away and so he asked us to go and investigate the areas that had been unveiled in particular there 
was one Spire an old facility of Clovis Bray design one that we had to investigate on Osiris's 
behalf when we arrived we found that the facility was designed to Cajun Ai and that it had been 
activated in the latest stages of the Golden Age by Clovis Bray clearly it had been created as 
part of a system meant to contain Rasputin but whilst there was an AI contained there it wasn't a 
remnant of the great warmind it was soteria the AI built by the Ishtar collective in Clovis Bray 
during the Golden Age the AI that had used Vex technology to incredibly accurately predict the 
future a future in which it forsaw the arrival of the black Fleet and had tried to save Humanity 
in the process it had been contained here for its Disobedience and for seemingly going rogue sataria 
was the reason that Rasputin knew about the encroaching forces of darkness and if she had been 
left to her own devices sataria might have been able to save some of the lives of humanity but 
now she was contained here save for her detached submind that she had sent out into the reaches of 
space which had been picked up by the people of Nuna our discoveries on Mars were important by 
digging deep into saria's prison the so-called Spire of The Watcher we were able to uncover yet 
more proof of the potential for a colony to exist out in the reaches of Neptune but this knowledge 
alone would not be enough to stop what was coming next now discoveries were important but Zorra 
was on the move and as the Coalition gathered to discuss what was to be done Rasputin found the 
solution to zeu wrath's trap the only solution was for the warsats to be destroyed and for him to 
perish along with them this way nobody risked using the warsats to inad advertently trigger zeu 
wrath's trap everything was coming to a head now and perhaps realizing that we weren't taking 
Zeus's bait perhaps seeing an opportunity to finally achieve her revenge Aramis forced our hand 
as we prepared on our own terms to destroy the warind the house of Salvation struck out in force 
and made their way to serap station Aramis would board the station and would move to activate the 
abhorent imperative prot had we gained control of the warat network we would have used them as tools 
against the witness's forces but under aramis's commands the warsats began to turn and targeted 
the traveler in a moment that shocked all that looked on as the abhorent imperative protocol was 
all but armed something began to move within the last City every Guardian could feel it like a 
great Cosmic Wind rushing toward them from the center of the city and as they all turned to look 
The Traveler moved the traveler was leaving just like it had with every civilization before it had 
chosen its moment the witness was nearly here it had decided that now it would abandon humanity and 
save itself as it had done countless times before it entered orbit and was quickly sworn wared with 
warsats deploying their weapons in preparation to fire over the comms mithrax pleaded with Aramis 
not to fire the warsats trying to speak for the sake of all their people that Aramis was unswayed 
and she would be under the watchful eyes of a darker presence she had made her choice she would 
take her revenge she activated the warsats which began to charge ready to fire in this moment 
when all for but a brief second felt like it would be lost Rasputin and Anna Bray made the 
brave sacrifice Rasputin told her that it was time he had devoted himself to the defense of 
the people of Saul he had bravely strowed back into the world when it had destroyed him and now 
he would sacrifice himself for the good of us all it was his Choice devotion bravery sacrifice he 
was deactivated he died and the warsat network was purged decimated before it could Fire 
And The Traveler it seemed was not blind to the tyrant's sacrifice it halted its Retreat 
hanging once again within Earth's orbit standing defiantly against the forces of of the witness 
it had seen the sacrifice of Humanity's greatest protector it would make its 
last stand above Earth once again in death Rasputin might have not destroyed 
the armies of the witness but he had undoubtedly saved Humanity he left us with a single message by 
decoding his deepest and long lost memory stores he had discovered Osiris's Lost Colony on Neptune 
he also discovered what the witness was looking for on the colony to us it was simply an unknown 
artifact known as the veil we wouldn't understand its significance for quite some time but it was 
the same artifact that savathun had hidden away the same artifact that had been used to create 
the witness by the precursor people the artifact of Darkness that they had tried to link to the 
traveler one of the tools the witness would use to enact the final shape we had to make our way 
to Neptune with all haste but in the wake of the war mine's death and the traveler using this 
last moment to make a valiant stand the great machine had been left exposed the day we had 
all dreaded was here the black Fleet made its final move in Earnest the second collapse was 
upon us and the witness would begin the final stages of the plan set in motion Millennia ago 
the witness would rise and the light would fall the time of endings had arrived as the pyramid 
Fleet made its way to Earth's atmosphere it was supported by the various ships of Call's loyalist 
Fleet his newly titled Shadow Legion whilst their vessels fell easily enough we had no defense 
against the black Fleet itself all the forces of the Coalition rallied to the side of humanity but 
we were helpless against the pyramids and from the mobile command vessel known as the helm all the 
coalition's leaders could do was stand back and watch but in this moment of remarkable tragedy 
something stirred within the traveler light it had detected Ed the witness's darkness aboard the 
lead vessel of the black Fleet and it struck back with a chaotic beam of pure potential and life 
the power of the light made manifest the pyramid vessel was sundered and overtaken with wild 
luminous growths as a new seed of Silver Wings was planted in its Hull at the heart of the beam 
the witness had been caught within its full power but as we would soon realize it was utterly 
unaffected and slowly began to approach The Traveler we tried our best to intercept the 
witness as it approached but it Unleashed its terrible Powers upon those Guardians that made 
their way to intercept it the ships the Guardians and their ghosts were atomically sliced apart 
they died instantly the ship amander holiday was amongst the attacking Squadron and whilst she 
wasn't hit by the witness's powers the debris from The Assault crashed into her vessel and she was 
forced to Earth Humanity's forces and the traveler itself had proved ineffective against the witness 
the black Fleet began to surround the traveler and enclosed it in some kind of containment field 
shuttering off its beam of light at long last the witness's grand Chas Cas was at an end it would 
reach out and upon reaching a certain proximity to The Traveler it would receive a vision it suddenly 
knew where the veil was perceiving it through the connection it had to The Traveler with all haste 
the witness sent its newest disciple Emperor callus and his shadow Legion to the location of 
the veil Neptune Osiris would quickly pursue them along with us now all the hopes of the universe 
would rest on our shoulders we didn't understand what the veil was we didn't understand why it 
was important all we knew was that the witness was searching for it and that its plans to end 
the universe relied upon it we quickly boarded a cabal vessel just before it dived into nearl light 
speed travel and we found ourselves exiting NLS at the edges of the system in the outer Giants we 
had seen Call's forces they were starting to touch down on the surface of Neptune and we helped at 
least in some regard some of Call's vessels were vulnerable from within and so we scuttled what 
we could before escaping to Neptune's surface in cabal drop pods we had to follow the cabal on 
a bit of a hope and a prayer diving deep into the clouds of a gas giant meant that we shouldn't 
have have been able to land in the first place but instead of falling endlessly through clouds 
and being crushed by immeasurable pressure we emerged into a neon soaked cityscape we had 
discovered Osiris's Colony we had rediscovered the secret human city of neomuna our arrival 
was quickly noticed by the local protectors the cloud Striders Nimbus and Rohan 12 12 foot 
tall cybernetically enhanced Warriors now stood at our side and they may have been tasked with 
defending their own people and their own City they weren't about to reject a little help if 
it was against the enemy that we had in common even as the cabal rained their drop pods down on 
the city the actual populace of this place was nowhere to be found neun's citizens had prepared 
for war and all of them had universally retreated into the cloud of AR a simulated reality created 
thanks to the connection that had been forged by the ne Moone technology to the veil it was also 
a great source of power for the city and it had helped to protect them from Vex incursions for the 
many years since their isolation but the Splendor of neomuna had also been tainted a large portion 
of this city had been crushed by the arrival of Call's vessel the Typhon imperator with it the 
shadow Legion had arrived in force accompanied by some of the witness's own personal forces 
they would be known to us later as the dread specifically though great hulking Abominations 
strowed forth alongside Call's forces they were the tormentors and they would be more than 
capable of going toe-to-toe with lightbearers Osiris's drop pod had landed nearby and he needed 
us to help break him out he did not have his own paracausal abilities of the light anymore after 
all he did not have the same strength that he once did even if his determination was the same 
as it had always been but before we freed him our ghost noticed an unknown source of energy that was 
paracausal in nature a mysterious verdant source of power it presented itself like threads and when 
we reached out we were overtaken with Darkness but this was not some festering corruption 
or some malignant thing it was the energy of potential of fate of purpose of connection we had 
found the signature of the darkness that emanated from the veil a new element at our Command for the 
first time we had discovered strand the power of the darkness that was very different to what the 
witness had shown us with stasis we had seen many individuals uals on both sides of the war use 
the powers of Darkness but to the best of our knowledge we were the first to ever wield strand 
our temporary surge in power allowed us to wipe out a large contingent of Shadow Legion troops 
but after some time we pushed ourselves too far and were momentarily exhausted we could not climb 
and Osiris had to be saved by the cloud Striders who easily took care of a Tormentor and several 
Shadow Legion troops after we had all regrouped we headed for the veils containment building but 
quickly discovered that it had been overrun with cabal we also saw the tools that the witness 
and callus had deployed against us paracausal disruptors they were preventing us from using our 
light and dark Powers pushing through regardless with Force of Arms alone we managed to approach 
the Overlook to the veil's containment building and we saw that it was overrun there our ghost 
was momentarily possessed again and it appeared momentarily as though we could glean valuable 
knowledge we saw a direct communication between callus and the witness whose voice emanated from 
our ghost we didn't know why but their plan was to link a device of some kind known as the radial 
Mast to the veil it was a relay device as we Now understand linking the veil and the traveler was 
the objective and so perhaps the radial Mast was a tool by which the witness could accomplish this 
this device whatever it might be could doubtless be found aboard Call's Flagship the Typhon 
imperator and so our next move was to assault it directly so we might destroy this device before it 
could be used when we reached the deepest chambers of the Typhon imperator Call's forces were waiting 
for us and his trap was sprung the shields around the radial Mast were utterly impenetrable and 
even though we momentarily regained control of strand we weren't able to break through our light 
was fading and were it not for kitle who attacked the vessel in force we would not have escaped our 
new strand powers that we had developed were of immediate interest to Osiris he believed that 
they might in fact be originating from the veil it was also of interest to Osiris on a tactical 
level it was a force that wasn't accounted for in the plans of callus or the witness Osiris would 
push us to gain a deeper understanding of this power and as we assisted the cloud Striders it 
seemed like it was still beyond our control we learned more and more about it but every time we 
pushed ourselves we would still feel our control eventually slip regardless the use of strand 
at all in our Arsenal was something that gave us progress the paracausal disruptors that callus 
had deployed didn't account for strand energy and they could be destroyed by it we would be able to 
use our strand powers without restraint to destroy the forces of the witness Osiris also made various 
further discoveries about the darkness uncovering the further truth that unlike the light which 
was based in the power of the physical Universe Darkness was based in the IM material the world 
of emotions thought will and fate an important understanding one that would further what we 
already knew the witness was not truly Darkness it was merely a user of it and even Darkness 
itself was not truly evil it was merely a force of the universe as basic as gravity regardless of 
what lessons might be learnt our teachings would be cut short Call's forces were making their moves 
and they were trying to bring the radial Mast to the veil we had to intervene quickly if such a 
link would Pro provide the witness with Victory no matter what that Victory looked like it had to 
be stopped so we set out with the cloud Striders to stop them Nimbus was way laid so with Rohan at 
our side we pushed forward to the veil containment facility our strand Powers were reaching New 
Heights and we used them to destroy various cabal commanders and even a few more powerful 
tormentors but when it came time to destroy the radial Mast our powers once again abandoned us and 
left us unable to fight the senior Cloud Strider Rohan made the ultimate sacrifice to destroy 
the radial Mast he bought us the victory that we needed at the price of his own life but there 
wasn't time to grieve this only reinforced to us that we needed to master our new powers or rohan's 
sacrifice would be for nothing but we discovered that our approach had been all wrong unlike stasis 
which was the element of control to master strand one must let go and accept one's place as a part 
of the weave the web of Fate that binds all life together after understanding this and realizing 
the truth of this matter we finally achieved a Mastery over Strand and not a moment too soon 
Call's forces were preparing to once again assault the veil containment facility and secure it so 
that the witness could finally do what it had been planning to do for eons it would link the veil to 
The Traveler allowing it to enact the final shape radial Mast or not if the veil was removed 
from neomuna by callus it could be brought to the witness it would not need a link it just 
needed it in its possession with empress kitle and Nimbus by our side we defended the facility 
as long as we could with kitle deploying her ascendancy forces to fight at our side but if 
eventually we were forced to retreat into the veil containment facility itself callus broke 
through the facility's defenses in a mad Rampage and beneath this object of ancient Darkness we 
faced off against the emperor using the powers of strand Amplified by the veil itself and in the 
end though his power was great though he believed that this would be the Glorious final battle 
of Our Lives it ended up being the last battle Battle of his we were victorious kitle would soon 
join us to mourn the man her father had been once again and as Nimbus also regrouped with us our 
ghost proclaimed that they were feeling strange we received word from Osiris all too late we had 
to get our ghost away from the veil as fast as possible once again it was too late our ghost had 
been possessed by the witness to understand what might have happened in this moment is difficult 
but I believe this Theory may be the correct answer the ghosts are part of the traveler made 
and forged from the same Cosmic flesh as its shell within them there is a cosmic link to the traveler 
itself the witness had needed the radial Mast an object of grand light in order to link the veil to 
The Traveler before but now it had another object of light using our own ghost and possessing it it 
would form the link it needed we couldn't bring ourselves to shoot our ghost down and prevent this 
moment we failed and a stream of cosmic energy erupted from the veil flying through the system 
and striking the traveler our ghost was saved by Nimbus but it was too late from The Command Deck 
of the helm the Coalition leaders watched as the witness enacted the next step of its plan this 
moment had been a million years in the making the witness approached the traveler unhindered 
and with its outstretched hand began to carve great lines into the Traveler's Divine flesh when 
those lines had joined the space between folded in on itself The Traveler had been dissected and 
a way into its pale heart had been opened the witness and some of its pyramid vessels ventured 
into this portal where at last the witness would be able to enact the final shape for good within 
the heart of the traveler the energies of the light and the Darkness could be merged to allow 
the witness a measure of ultimate control over the universe there would be no more life no more 
death death only a stagnant limbo where nothing would change a final shape that would be exactly 
for the witness alone to command and control we stood before the portal and beheld our failure 
it was over we had lost but even with this great defeat our struggles were not yet done it 
would take time for the witness to complete its plans in Earnest and while it worked within 
the traveler itself we would still see its forces rampaging across the system on Nuna we would 
work with Nimbus to uncover more about the veil and confirmed something of our most ancient 
and original foe the heart of the black garden we learned that the heart of the black garden had 
been a failed copy of the veil we also managed to find the lost submind of soteria which told us 
of critically important information it told us that an enemy of the witness resided on Titan and 
that if we were to save all of existence we would need to venture there to secure Victory but Titan 
had not emerged from the witness's clutches it had still been abducted and even many months later 
was nowhere to be found in the meantime there were other pressing matters to attend to the citizens 
of neomuna were having nightmares this might seem trivial at first nightmares are normally just 
things of fear these were different they all spoke with the same cruel Twisted voice one that seemed 
to invite laughter the demise and Dread that it brought and eventually we would start hearing 
this voice too in our waking moments we would hear it all the more clearly when we held certain 
relics of nzar we heard his voice deep within the Vex Network and in some quiet places on neomuna 
in its Central plazas as they were being attacked as long as we held something connected to nazar's 
past the Echoes of the final God of pain rang out through our ears the voice was beckoning us it was 
an invitation an invitation that would eventually take us to essence what remained of the witness's 
pyramid ship the personal vessel that had been attacked by the Traveler's light the beam of the 
traveler had changed this place irrevocably it had grown into a wild place of light and dark the 
roots of a new tree of Silver Wings had started to grow and to crack the obsidian Stone of the 
vessel's structure and the roots of this new tree had skewered something of remarkable importance 
nar's interred remains after his dissection by the Fallen the witness had salvaged all that remained 
of the disciple and had placed him in a state of suspension on board the pyramid vessel nzar was 
technically dead but not too dead to dream only nazar's head had been recovered and yet as a 
tree might grow from a seed within his cont mment nzar was beginning to regrow as well his 
body was filled not just with the paracausal energies of his original Darkness but with the 
new wild growth of the light his strength was returning and with one of the roots piercing 
his containment whenever the tree grew so did he as we ventured through we had to feed light and 
darkness to the roots of the tree of Silver Wings to progress and as the tree grew so too did nzar 
we would hear his heartbeat it would sound the Doom that would approach should he properly return 
to the world and at the Apex of his power when he had completely regrown we would face him his 
grotesque new body was an abomination of light and dark but with his old weapon night terror in 
hand he sought to devour our fear and unleash his gluttonous wroth upon this doomed new world he 
had returned to reap the pain and suffering that he believed he was owed but thanks to our own 
Mastery of light and darkness we were stronger we struck down the disciple just as we had done 
to R just as we had done to callus but as his strength faded once again we heard the love last 
fleeting words of nzar promising that his memory would never fade and that even in our quietest 
moments we would know his voice it is still unknown if he lives on in some psychic form but 
he has come back from the grave once before right before our own eyes it is possible that we haven't 
seen the end of this terrible Force just yet back on Earth the witnesses other forces the shadow 
Legion remnants even after Call's defeat were continuing to conduct their Dark Master's purposes 
as primitive as it sounds the witness would carry out many of its following actions purely for the 
sake of hatred and for the infliction of pain it wanted us to experience the same helplessness that 
its creators had when they were abandoned by The Traveler the people of Earth were being kidnapped 
by the forces of the witness and rounded up into well-defended prison camps it was here that Mara 
s intervened she had seen how we had mastered both the light and now a new form of Darkness she had 
seen that we had ascended and that all those who stood at our side were worthy she named us as one 
of her new Queen's guard members of a great and Regal order and alongside devim K Amanda holiday 
mithrax and the crow we would conduct many daring raids in order to break the people of Earth out of 
the prisons of the witness after raiding multiple prisons successfully a trap was laid for us it 
was meant to destroy us all but we got a strange warning of sorts from an old foe Aramis had seen 
her faith in the witness shaken what the witness had done to her people had challenged her Beyond 
even the great machine's betrayal she would sit and think and then she would break her Allegiance 
with the witness she herself was broken not in body but in spirit she didn't care for vengeance 
anymore she had seen it enacted as she had turned the key to fire the warsats she believed she had 
achieved it only for defeat to be snatched from the jaws of Victory once again she had made the 
choice and even though there were no repercussions she realized that her heart simply wasn't in it 
if the world was going to end she didn't care anymore she would eventually leave the system and 
look for her long lost mate arthis but before she could find her she warned us of the Trap that was 
being laid before us and tried to steer us clear she had always been our enemy and so we ignored 
her warnings whilst many of us would Escape it was Amanda holiday that would pay the price 
for our refusal to listen Aramis was able to save mythrax from being enveloped in an explosion 
evening the score for the time he had showed her mercy when hunting down nar's relics but Amanda 
was now dead gone she had given her last full measure so that the people who were trapped could 
Escape her death shook us all Crow was distraught despite his past life they had become friends 
and though the relationship they had developed was complicated by what Aldren had done to Cade 
Amanda was still of the understanding that he was a different person at very least even if 
emotionally speaking she was having a lot of trouble connecting with him but it was Zavala who 
was most affected he had watched The Traveler give the light to The Hive he had watched it nearly 
abandon the people of Earth he had watched it do nothing as the people he loved in cared for died 
from his adopted son to his wife to the woman he'd come to know first like a daughter and then as 
one of his oldest friends zavala's Faith broke he cursed The Traveler with his words if it would 
not lift a finger to save his people then he would become like Atlas once again he would shoulder 
the burden of the coming War for the survival of all life in the universe the war that would begin 
its next phase beneath the methane Seas of Titan and with the words of a long lost Leviathan 
who would at last be roused from the deep before we made our way to Titan before it 
had even been returned to us we attempted the most obvious course of action a portal an 
entrance into the side of the traveler had been carved by the witness we had to see if we could 
follow we sent an exploratory ship to follow in the witness's Wake the guardian aboard joxer was 
found in what was left of the ship's wreckage he had been cosmically shifted he had been phased 
into the hull of the vessel before it had been spat out of the portal as though he had been 
moved and reassembled on a Quantum level fused into the vessel we would need to find a way to 
guarantee our safe passage entering the portal in this state was a Fool's Gambit doomed to 
failure but luckily for us our first clue would present itself in due time Titan reemerged from 
the dimension the witness had abducted it to and immediately we started receiving an emergency 
distress signal from an all too familiar voice Deputy Commander Sloan she was alive she had 
survived all these years in isolation and she was now calling for help Zavala immediately sent 
a contingent of Titan forces including Saint 14 and Lord Saladin to find her we were also deployed 
to the recovery force and The Drifter would also decide to tag along supposedly more out of mere 
curiosity than anything else though by this point his involvement in our plans was realistically 
of his own valtion he knew that Zavala would grow Reckless and so The Drifter endeavored to use his 
years of adventuring expertise to temper zavala's ambition with a little practical wisdom as we 
touched down on Titan it was clear that something wasn't right a Remnant force of Hive appeared to 
still be on the archology that wasn't so unusual but as it turned out these forces belonged to the 
hive God of War Zorra after our initial assaults began we were greeted by a terrifying sound of 
the likes of which we had not heard until that day Zeus's voice echoed through our minds amplifying 
the ferocity of her forces weakening our resolve she enraged and taunted saint for his failure to 
prevent sagira's death for not being there to be at his partner's side and defend him from her 
High celebrant his rage was palpable but other than Breaking the advancing Hive on his Gauntlet 
and face plate there was little he could do when we stopped Zeus's rituals and interference we 
noticed that the signal of Sloan's distress call was coming not from somewhere on the archology 
platforms but instead from Deep beneath the waves zala immediately tried to get us to jump into 
the ocean in the most direct of Fashions but The Drifter had a better idea he transported us to 
his ship knowing that we didn't have the necessary equipment to survive the crushing pressure of 
Titan's oceans when we were properly outfitted we headed down through the methane Seas and found our 
way to a Subterranean dive tank a research center from the Golden Age there we found Sloan and saw 
that she had been infused with taken corruption her mind was still her own but the corruption 
would allow her to tune into the orders being given by Zeo wrath it was not something she had 
gained of her own valtion it was an Affliction she could still hear The Whispers of zeu in her mind 
and the the stress of her long campaign was clear from the start Sloan was strong stronger than 
perhaps a thousand other Titans but the burden she had chosen to bear was utterly Monumental 
greater than any other guardian's burden in that time it is hard to resist the strength of a 
God let alone zeu a wrath when one stands alone but luckily for Sloan in her years of isolation 
on Titan she might have been the only Guardian but she wasn't truly alone along with her ghost 
she had made another Ally from behind the viewport of the dive pod a giant creature swam into view 
placing its eye directly up to the port hole for all to gaze upon it Sloan had found a survivor of 
a primordial species the last of the original worm Gods the worms that had not been corrupted by the 
witness but had instead dead been whales of the great oceans of fundament she had found the one 
who had escaped the witness's corruption and now sought its downfall just as we did this was the 
legendary Leviathan of Titan the monster behind the glass as Drifter would call them the long boy 
in the soup and her name was Assa Sloan had been saved from zeu clutches by the great Leviathan 
and it had promised her assistance in the fight ahead assistance that included asa's intimate 
knowledge of the witness's origins in order to access this information though the link that Assa 
had forged between her own mind and the mind of Deputy Commander Sloan would need to be reinforced 
to do this we would use some of the tools of the witness against it egregor the fungus that we had 
found aboard the Leviathan had also infested tit Seas growing as a sort of coral in the deepest 
reaches of the seabed egregor spores open one's mind to Darkness and allow psychic connections 
that would otherwise snap under the weight of one's waking mind Assa and Sloan could use this 
Coral to strengthen their connection and allow a communion of sorts after enough infusions of it 
Assa was able to fully communicate to us through Sloan she told us of the witness's origins of 
how the precursor people had once also enjoyed the Traveler's Bounty of how they had sought to 
merge it with the veil to create the final shape and of how the traveler had rejected the synthesis 
and had fled it was also here that we learned of the terrible cost that the precursors paid to 
create the witness merging their minds into a single compound being using the powers of Darkness 
that they had learned from the veil this was how the witness was born and ASA promised that soon 
she would be able to tell us of one who knew how to defeat it but Titan's return to the system was 
caused for much more than our own discoveries the Lucent brood were on the move again and shortly 
after Titan's return a massive Lucent Hive vessel crashed down into the methane seas and sank 
beneath the waves this was no accident this was deliberate it had been sunken to a specific 
point near the bottom of the ocean near the new Pacific archology but the loosen Hive had worked 
to secure the platform above with a small army The Hive up top were enacting a ritual to try and 
cloak the entrance to the archology drilling platform the one area that we might use to access 
the seabed and Enter The Vessel for ourself and so Sloan sent us to to investigate and stop the hive 
ritual we put an end to this ritual of concealment but it was clear that the objective that the 
Lucent Hive had crashed their ship for was down on the bottom of the seabed and so accessing the 
drilling platform we dove into darkness the only viable method of reaching the bottom of the sea 
Flor was to follow the archology down and so we did marching on the dark sea floor of Titan to 
reach the crashed vessel the loosen Hive here were risen from various Broods most notably of 
all though were those of the taken King orx and his banished son nocis something nefarious was 
taking place here after we defeated the newly risen ecar the sword of orx now Shield of savathun 
we headed deeper into the lowest reaches of the ship where we met the sea be head and there we saw 
the objective of the loosened Hive it was a body gargantuan in size with an all too familiar face 
one that had once spelled Doom for the system it was orx his body had been pulled from its low 
orbit of Saturn into the gravitational anomaly when Titan was abducted it had then plummeted 
into Titan's atmosphere and Fallen into the Seas it rested now on the sea floor and the Lucent Hive 
had discovered the king's remains their plan was not simple but if it worked it would truly change 
the nature of the system forever using a mixture of the light and ncis's powers of necromancy 
taught to savathun's brood the Lucent Hive there were attempting to raise one of the most powerful 
and ancient foes that Humanity had ever known as a Lucent Hive a lightbearer with or's power 
would be nearly Unstoppable a taken King reborn in the loosen Sheen of the light would be a force 
Beyond Reckoning the danger was evident immediate and apparent without little thought or hesitation 
we crushed the ghost that was being used in this ritual and engaged the loosen Hive wizard at the 
rituals heart in her former life this wizard had been in one of ncis's high necromancers maybe 
it was her plan maybe it was something she had found from her old life a talent that persisted 
beyond death but it would not be put to use we managed to stop the ritual just in time but this 
made us once again pay attention to the hive of savathun's brood they could not be trusted to 
conduct themselves without engaging in plans that could so disaster for us even as the Doom 
of the world approached they were making their own schemes and such things could uproot what 
remained of the structure of the universe to their advantage we would need to keep a closer 
eye on them in the future as we were preparing to commune with Assa One Last Time Zorra struck 
again she had abducted Assa and her Wizards had dragged her into the deep there in a dark ritual 
chamber deeper than any other that we had ventured to we would need to find Assa before the ritual of 
the hive was complete when we arrived we realized what the plan of zeor Wrath was given enough 
time and given no distractions the Wizards of zoro's coven would take Assa and if they 
succeeded our one chance the one person who could give us information necessary to defeat the 
witness would be lost to us we descended into the ritual butchered zoro's Wizards and brought Assa 
back just in time as we returned her to the dive tank Sloan's burden of corruption momentarily 
overpowered her and she spoke with the voice of the hive God of War zeu wrath chastised Sloan for 
her weakness before the strength of the god of war proclaiming that without War Sloan was nothing 
Sloan even put her blade to Commander zala's throat in that moment and would have killed him 
but Zavala was of sound mind and calm voice his Direction centered Sloan again he spoke with the 
conviction not of a commander but of a friend and with the power to Rouse Sloan from her corruption 
she wasn't alone she had always had her friends by her side Zeus's corruption faded and an entirely 
different voice emerged from Sloan's mouth she spoke once more with Assa voice she was freed 
Assa conveyed through Sloan her most vital truth that the one who hides truth in deception knew 
the way in order to follow the witness into the traveler we would need to resurrect savathun once 
more the witch Queen had to be returned for our path forward to be carved she would rise again 
or all life in the universe would be forfeit the mere suggestion of this enraged Saladin and St 
14 they had both fought long and hard against the influence of this evil Saint in particular was 
Furious given what savathon had done to Osiris but we had no choice to prevent the end of all things 
we would need to resurrect savathun the hidden still held custody of her remains in a Secure 
Vault they had been studied by Eris mourn and they were mostly a nerd but they could be resurrected 
at any time all they needed was imaru her ghost he would be the next one to lead us on our path 
forward and a dark path indeed it would be savathun has always been cunning and she knew 
that she might die at our hands one day she had prepared contingencies just in case such 
an event might happen and had left the those contingencies in the capable hands of her ghost 
imaru after we discovered his important role in all this he would reach out to us voluntarily as 
his instructions from his master dictated he would Resurrect The Witch Queen but on one condition 
we had to deal with Zorra The Hive God of War destroying a hive God is no small feat and we 
had barely any time in in which to do it we could not so easily locate Zeus's Throne world of 
the black Terrace and so dealing a final death to zeu would be next to Impossible we would need to 
fight the power of one hiive God with a hive God of our own there were perhaps only two people who 
knew the rituals of the hive with intimacy enough to conduct such an affair the uncooperative and 
partly deceased warlock tollen into the shatter and the newly Rising witch Aris mourn the last 
bane of the osmium Dynasty using Hive rituals and dark magics Aris would enact the most terrifying 
ritual imaginable within a revealed secret Spire in savathun's Throne world and with green soulfire 
in her heart and Hive scripture in her throat Aris began to ascend with ourselves imaru and 
iora standing as witnesses to the event we saw as she invoked the names of those who desired 
Vengeance against Zeo wrath and the osmium Dynasty she mantled Vengeance and Vengeance became her 
blade she was lifted into the air before us and began to change her form Twisted spines growing 
from her back claws elongating from fingers the ritual grew in intensity until it was a raging 
Firestorm of green flame and then it was over now Eris MN stood before us ascended into the 
hive God of Vengeance she was transformed and she was now our only hope of defeating Zorra her 
first words after this apotheosis would Define our mission bring me your tithes and so we did 
Eris M had created an acolytes staff for us to use it allowed us to use the destruction that we 
had become so Adept at creating to tithe power to erism just like any other Hive would to one of 
their own Gods though the staff was designed to prevent us from having to partake in the hive's 
own blood tithe which eternally bound them to the path of violence using our own powers and offering 
them up as tithes we would be able to empower Aris and if she grew powerful enough she would be able 
to take on the hive God of War but the task ahead of us was utterly Monumental and fraught with 
danger zeu was the Conqueror of a thousand worlds and her might was near insurmountable already we 
would need to collect as many countless tributes of violence for Aris as we could muster and all 
the while she would be subject to an unending barrage of scrutiny the tower had been slowly 
pushed further and further with ais's magic and every time it had proved its usefulness but every 
time the boundaries were pushed further still this would be a step too far for many aoro would 
Shield Eris from the scrutiny of the tower where she could even as she fostered some of her own 
doubts but many others looked upon ais's choices with fear and frustration in equal measure none 
more so than Elsie Bray The exost Stranger who had experienced many a dark future where Eris MN 
had ascended To Rule The Hive a moment that had brought ruin and Calamity to all of Saul and the 
Guardians of the light as we continued to explore savathun's Spire at the heart of her throne World 
Zeus's forces would make a move of their own pushing in and invading savathun's Throne world 
zeu would Delight in eris's transformation she believed that she was now embodying the Soul and 
Spirit of orx the taken King in being the one who wielded his Slayers she had embraced the mantle of 
a hive God she might easily take his place place as first navigator in time at very bare minimum 
she would stand alongside her as yet a new sister or's purpose reincarnated zeu was hopeful that 
Eris mour might simply embrace the power of the hive but eris's resolve was greater than even 
zeu had realized a mistake that would be her downfall in the end after many preparations 
had been made we would eventually manage further Explorations into savathun's Throne world 
we discovered that below the highest reaches of savathun's spire but above the low ubet in which 
the altars of summoning were located there was a secret chamber within the Spire this hidden 
chamber was known as the imaru engine imaru is a dangerous and unique concept that was 
effectively created and weaponized by savath she is a hive God of deception and she gains power 
whereever lies and ignorance take root in baru is essentially the empowering of savathun by one's 
own ignorance an entire engine built around such a concept was designed as a puzzle one meant to 
confound and confuse it would slowly unlock over time inviting us into its inner reaches to delve 
into deeper Secrets still but the mysteries of the the imaru engine would have to wait ze's 
forces were being masked and it was clear that there would be a final confrontation with us 
soon imaru believed the situation had turned hopeless and was on the cusp of fleeing but he 
was forced to remain even when he knew that Aris had not collected enough violent tithes to 
challenge zeor wrath but iora and arys had a plan a bold Gambit they would get only one chance 
and if it failed all of creation was being held in the balance after we defeated one of Zeus's 
great Champions and conducted one last tithe to Aris aora entered the ritual space in the alts 
of summoning and had savathun's body ported in imaru was instructed that despite the terms of 
our agreement having not been completed this was his last chance to resurrect his guardian and 
so begrudging ly he did so and life was breathed back into the witch Queen savathun returned to us 
from the dead and immediately made an about turn to approach Aris mour Aris would only utter four 
words in response to the witch Queen's musings on her new form I am your ruin and with blinding 
speed Aris took her blade in her hand and cut the witch Queen's throat this had been a true 
death of one of the high of gods in their own Throne World more importantly unlike when we had 
slain savathun arys was able to claim her power as a god of the hive the power that Eris claimed 
by killing savathun in combination with the tithes of the Guardians had momentarily left erism as the 
most powerful Hive God in existence the taken King and first navigator the god of lies and deception 
the God of War all of them were nothing before Aris mourn The Unbroken Blade the god of Vengeance 
and Aris turned her WTH on the God of War she had all the might in the universe at her fingertips 
everything that the hive had ever done everything that they could ever be was hers to command if 
Aris had desired she could have gone on from this moment to conquer all of the city To Rule The Hive 
and to become their dark master but in their frail sword logic she saw the weakness of the hive 
tempting as the very nature of godhood itself might be ais's conviction was Stronger she did not 
succumbed to corruption instead she made a choice that would define the nature of ze's existence 
forever to kill zeu would have been following the hive's own way and would ensure that she stayed a 
god forever her Transformations had been momentary brief as she absorbed the power within the ubet 
every time the Guardians made a tithe but if she killed zeu she would be transformed permanently 
but she had made a solemn vow to iora and to The Drifter that she planned to be with them and 
even in the face of godhood this vow stayed true so AOS summoned her power and instead of using 
it as the sword logic might demand to kill she used it to banish zor wrath from her own Throne 
world this action took all of her power and she would not be able to hold on to it because her 
actions were not in keeping with the sword logic Aris was reverted to her mortal human form and 
fell to the ground but in the moment that she had collapsed Zeus's whales of grief could be heard 
across the ascendant plain Aris had rejected the notion that she was orex born again she had 
shown the hive God of War exactly why she was the bane of the osmium Dynasty Zorra had had her 
strength shattered she would never again be able to return to her throne world she was banished 
from it she was now mortal her next death would be her last savathun was quickly raised once 
again by amaru and seeing us standing by Aris and aora she quickly realized that there was 
a real chance that she would be defeated again if fighting began to break out between between 
them and so she agreed to a temporary Armistice of sorts she left imaru with us as collateral the 
entire reason for us resurrecting the witch Queen was so that she could tell us of how to pursue 
the witness and savathun had given us no clues about what this method was when we inquired she 
said that the way would reveal itself soon and so it did when we delved deeper into the imaru 
engine we unlocked the deepest final chamber within it there was the greatest curiosity of all 
and the answer to our questions an egg the Egg of an aamar A Wish Dragon this was one of riven's 
clutch it was much unlike the eggs ruined by taken corruption in the dreaming City there was 
still life within this egg it was the hint we needed to continue our investigation we realized 
that we were going to need to use wish magic and an aramara in order to pass through and follow the 
witness but what's more we remembered back to the moment of savathun's resurrection and deduced 
that there was a pattern in her wings but this wasn't just any pattern this was a wish something 
meant to be put specifically to one Dragon above all others Riven of a thousand voices this was a 
unique code to be inputed on the device known as the wishing wall that Mara had constructed to 
more specifically bargain with Riven without adverse consequences and finally it was revealed 
what this wish was a wish to follow the witness the fabled and lost 15th wish savathun had 
made it and savathun had hidden it away all along this would be our deliverance suddenly our 
path was clear the only way for us to follow the witness into the Traveler's pale heart was using 
the wish magic of an aamar and there was perhaps only one of the dead dragons that still had 
the power to Grant a wish of this magnitude a dragon that had had dealings with savathun 
before Riven Riven of a thousand voices the last known aramara in snar of The Forsaken Prince 
damning perpetrator of the curse on the dreaming City and maras sovs Greatest Secret in order to 
enter the heart of the traveler we would need to bargain with Riven even though we had been her 
murderers but we clearly had no choice and so we returned once again to the dreaming City to face 
the old monster that we had slain so long ago in the name of avenging our fallen friend Cade 6 the 
Final Act of our story was about to unfold [Music] aamar are strange beings indeed they can be killed 
but even in death they are able to manifest their powers of wish Magic from something as small as 
a Shard of bone one can make a wish that will spell disaster or change fate irrevocably seeing 
riven's clutch knowing that her remains still lay in the dreaming City and knowing that the teans 
had secured her heart we knew where we had to go next after hearing the news of our plan the 
awoken Corsair mobilized with all haste it was perhaps not surprising that if we were going to 
deal with Riven we would need to use the wishing wall Mara had constructed it long ago to deal 
with Riven in a more controlled manner but even in death the wishing wall still held power and 
Riven would be able to grant wishes to those who used it properly this was how we would input the 
15th wish and even though Riven was dead she would still be able to Grant One Last Wish that being 
said we would need some of her remains to power the process properly and so we descended upon 
the Queen's walk where we had killed Riven years earlier despite the interception of the Vex of the 
Soul divisive we managed to secure one of riven's teeth and taking this to the wishing wall we were 
able to invoke the power of the long dead Dragon rumors had long swirled of the long lost 15th 
wish that we would cherish but it had not been found until now but when we approached in order to 
make this wish upon the wishing wall Riven refused to Grant it Mara and Riven would have Stern words 
the two great beings of power spoke once more with her Tean focusing riven's Spirit within the hearts 
that they had contained thus a great manifestation of riven's spirit as large as her original size 
appeared before Mara and spoke with the queen of the reef they bargained once again as they had 
done when they created the dreaming City but this time all of creation was up in the balance as a 
price of granting savathun's wish Riven demanded that we gathered her remaining eggs and gave them 
a chance at life this would mean the return of a species that the Guardians had put to the torch 
and driven to Extinction it would mean the return of the aamar and their potentially dangerous wish 
magic to the system and beyond it would change everything in ways unforeseen but the alternative 
was Oblivion we had no choice and so we accepted riven's bargain Riven had hidden the remnants 
of her clutch within her Lair a space within the ascendant realm and the L lines that was also 
attached to the dreaming City one we would have to enter via the dreaming City's portals but 
something had happened when we arrived at the heart of riven's Lair it turned out that her eggs 
of this clutch had been scattered across the lay lines all seven of them were missing but it wasn't 
the witness or marov who had done this there was another Force at play here we would discover 
who it was when we pursued the vex of the Soul divisive they had stolen one of riven's eggs and 
managed to transport it into their own domain the black garden as we approached the eggs location 
it was clear that Riven had been here long before paracausal Echoes of where she had been had been 
left but strangely enough there were different Echoes there as well Echoes from another wish 
dragon as we approached the site we found the egg unharmed and it was next to something that maybe 
one of us did expect Riven perhaps hoped against all hope but lying there next to the egg were the 
remains of another aamar one that she had known well the bones reached out to Crow and petitioned 
him they wished to use him to give voice to their words and he obliged thus we heard the words of 
of the aamar known as tanus riven's mate he had been the one to scatter the eggs but he was not 
an aggressor he was actually their savior he had kept himself hidden in the black garden where his 
lair was located long after he and Riven had made their clutch they had both managed to survive and 
were communicating still quietly whispering in the spaces between realities but when Riven was 
taken by orx tyranus knew that their clutch was in danger of falling to corruption they too might 
be lost and the future of their entire species was in Jeopardy out of love for Riven and for their 
unborn children tanus did the one thing that no aamar must do he fed on his own desire and granted 
his own wish a wish to keep his and riven's clutch safe until a wish keeper could come along to 
reunite the clutch we would be that wish keeper but the death of tanus would be the price of 
this wish aamar must never grant their own wishes because it forces their desires to feed upon 
their own existence by granting his own wish tanus forfeit his own life but then again he was most 
unlike other aamar unlike his Brethren he did not twist the wishes of his petitioners his way was a 
different way that the ahamkara could use to exist and his lessons for Riven and their children would 
hopefully Echo into the future his kind-hearted nature was a novelty amongst his kin but it didn't 
have to be so future Generations if properly stewarded by marov and the awoken could learn 
to follow tanis's way instead as we progressed to discover more of riven's eggs she would come 
forward to to us with an admission of Truth her bargain with savathun the 15th wish would only 
transport a single person into the pale heart if we were to take this wish and go as that singular 
person we would have to face the witness alone in the face of this new realization there were many 
difficult decisions to be had but it was Crow who would ultimately rise to the occasion he and Mara 
still shared their Cosmic link even though he had died and been reborn as a guardian that link 
connected them even if one of them stepped into another dimension Crow realized that he could step 
into the pale heart of the traveler and Mara would still be able to find him using their link and the 
entangled properties of the veil and the traveler Crow and Mara's link would be able to be used by 
Osiris who would coordinate it with the signal of the veil and the traveler thus creating a safe 
passage into the pale heart that the rest of us would follow however Crow would have to go first 
Mara didn't initially approve of the idea but she also knew that a part of her relationship with her 
reborn brother could only be mended if she allowed her sibling the freedom to choose his own path and 
to be the Arbiter of his own fate and so Mara did the most difficult thing she had ever been asked 
to do she relinquished her control and agreed to Crow's plan when we located riven's final egg it 
was initially stolen away by the scorn however these scorn were not under the control of the 
witness instead they had flown under the banner of an old and eternal foe FAL The Fanatic he had 
directed his scorn to acquire the egg and with their own uncontrolled desires the scorn might 
have fed the young aramara if they weren't careful leading to potential disaster but F roll's forces 
were no match for us and we recovered this final egg though F roll's presence would be a dire 
Omen for the future at last Riven agreed and decided to grant the 15th wish it would consume 
the rest of her energy meaning she would no longer be able to manifest as a spirit this was perhaps 
the last time she would commune with us but she was ready for what came next and the future of 
her brood had been secured so she granted the 15th wish and summoned forth a passage way into 
the heart of the traveler Crow passed through and Mara could sense that he was indeed on his way 
Riven having played her part folded back into the whispered edges of reality her work now complete 
and her true Last Wish having been granted at last it would take Chrome months to pass into the pale 
heart and it would take Osiris months to prepare the veil for the connection but we would spend 
our time wisely Guardians rearmed and prepared to venture into the pale heart in force venturing 
into the light like this would require new arms and so Lord Shack released an arsenal of new tools 
for us to make use of old weapons as well from our distant past that had at one point been Terrors 
within his own Crucible the Guardians held the forces of the witness at Bay as their Onslaught 
flooded across earth in unending waves and we gathered as much power to ourselves as we could 
until at last the day had come Osiris made contact with us telling us that there was interference 
between the signal of the veil and the traveler perhaps this was one final attempt by the forces 
of the witness to prevent Crow from accessing the pale heart the source of the interference 
originated from an all too familiar place the black garden clearly our oldest foes the Vex 
of the Soul divisive were up to their old games using riven's secret pathway from the dreaming 
City into the black garden we stormed the soul divisive territory and found ourselves looking 
once more Upon A Familiar sight a circular doorway opening in segments revealing a monster ous 
Thing festering Once More the soul divisive had created another heart of the black garden another 
floored copy of the veil this had been done with the assistance of the witness and its purpose was 
now clear once again if left to their own devices the Vex might have been able to use this heart to 
supersede the veil's signal and lock us out of the pale heart of the traveler for good but for all 
their predict power these Vex did not foresee that we would return to the sight of our first Conquest 
10 years later and where before we had conquered the pale heart as a novice now we returned as 
a godslayer the soul divisive were defeated and once again the heart was banished the pathway 
to the veil was complete as the interference died down at long last was ejected on the other side 
of the portal and fell into the Strange Land of the Traveler's pale heart almost immediately upon 
Landing he started taking fire a stranger on the ridge but it turned out this stranger bore an 
all too familiar face whether because of wish magic or the light of the traveler or some other 
strange circumstance Crow found himself flat on his back facing an all too familiar Gunslinger 
holding the Ace of Spades Cade six if it wasn't for glint quick appearance and the realization 
that Crow wasn't Aldren Cade might have ended him there but they were quick to realize the truth and 
stood side by side before the festering evil that the witness was creating in the pale heart an evil 
that was almost ready to fulfill its purpose for now the time of endings is upon us whether the 
sun rises again on a world free of the witness or whether it sets eternally and rests in its part 
of the final shape know this of the many thousands of lessons taught to us over these last 10 years 
lessons hard earned through victory and failure there is one that has stood the test of time like 
no other and it is simply this Guardians make their own fate when you step into the pale heart 
of the traveler and confront the witness remember you are the Arbiter of your own future and by no 
will but your own can you be deterred you are no mere instrument of the light you are no mere tool 
of the dark you have transcended your purpose and become something more you are the one who moves 
time forward you are the architect of the future you are the reason for victory on the horizon and 
so go forth and do as a guardian does for you are no mere protector you are the wild growth of 
the garden's heart you are the battle that makes waves Eternal you are the prime mover of 
your own prophecies because you you are destiny
